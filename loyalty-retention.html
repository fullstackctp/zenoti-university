                      There’s no denying that highly skilled service providers
                      are the foundation of the salon and spa industry. You may
                      have the friendliest team members, a gorgeous salon, and
                      the best technology, but if your staff can’t execute an
                      <b>amazing technical service,</b>
                      nothing else matters. That’s why a successful training
                      program and emphasis on education is critical for your
                      business.

                      What’s the next big differentiating factor between a new

                    </p>
                    <p><b>Trust. </b></p>
                    <p>
                      Trust is earned when actions meet words. Your current
                      guests are returning because you earned their trust
                      through the service you provide and the quality of the
                      recommendations that you give. And they demonstrate this
                      appreciation by spending more money.

                      Because they are more likely to consider recommendations
                      of new services and products from someone they trust. This
                      opens the door to upgrades, add-ons, and product
                      purchases, all of which result in dollar signs. Higher
                      ticket sales also mean higher gratuity for the service
                      providers, which keeps your talent happy and lowers
                      turnover rates.

                      We’ve all had our bad days. Maybe a color formulation
                      didn’t take right, or sensitive skin caused an adverse
                      reaction during a treatment. It happens. The good news is
                      that when those bad days hit, loyal guests are more likely
                      than a new guest to give you another chance. They also
                      offer valuable feedback over their lifetime visits that
                      helps you to improve your business, address a problem
                      before it grows, or coach a team member on their
                      performance.

                      Your guests want to belong to something. They want to feel
                      like they have finally found their beauty and wellness
                      expert and their "place.” <b>Offering programs </b>and
                      <b>launching initiatives</b> initiatives to keep them
                      engaged and returning helps them to feel valued as your
                      guest. They’re giving you their business, but what is in
                      it for them (besides a beautiful haircut)?

                    <p>
                      When we speak about guest retention, we're referring to
                      the percentage of guests who returned for their next
                      service within 90 days of their latest visit. That's
                      slightly less than the industry average, so when setting
                      goals, we would suggest you aim higher.
