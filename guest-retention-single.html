                    guests coming back — but doing so takes more than exemplary
                    service alone. So, to help, we’ve developed a course that
                    provides an overview of the key elements of guest loyalty,

              If you’re already providing high-quality procedures, maintenance
              tips and tricks, and great service, you might be wondering why
              it’s so important to take additional steps to retain your guests.
            </p>
            <p>Let us explain:</p>

                <li class="mt-1">
                  You worked hard to build your current guest base and it likely
                  wasn’t cheap to do so. In fact, it can cost 5x more to acquire
                  a new guest than to retain an existing one. That's why your
                  goal should be to keep customers loyal by offering exemplary
                  guest service and programs that they will find valuable. With
                  only 30% of guests likely to return after their first visit,
                  it’s essential that you employ tools that guarantee their
                  return.

                  Did you know that repeat business from happy guests is the
                  biggest contributor to revenue? Our customer data shows that
                  over 77% of a spa or salon’s revenue comes from guests who
                  have visited over four times in a year. Cultivating their
                  loyalty and maximizing their participation in your programs
                  and offerings is important to your business. The more that you
                  can drive their frequency of visit, and get them involved in
                  what you offer, the more committed they'll be to your brand.

                  not shy to share that experience with their network. That's a
                  huge compliment — but above all, it’s a huge contribution to

              It's time to start treating your regular guests as valuable
              members of your salon and spa family. And a
              <b>loyalty program</b> can help you do just that.
            </p>
            <p>
              An effective loyalty program keeps guests coming back to your
              salon or spa, even as you face challenges like staff churn and
              growing competition. Loyalty programs can be as simple or as
              robust as you want. A business can honor rewards based on spend
              amount or guest behavior, such as providing a review, rebooking,
              or referring a friend.
            </p>
            <p>
              Loyalty programs are proven to keep guests engaged with your brand
              and your program. It’s a powerful way to avoid discounting by
              awarding extra points to encourage guests to try new services and
              products, or to book during a timeframe with lower utilization
              rates.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              A good loyalty program requires little effort from your staff and
              creates an exemplary experience for your guests, helping to
              improve relationships and drive loyalty.

              Now think about a Thursday afternoon when it’s BOGO Happy Hour, or
              the first Friday in November when they are gifting a free holiday
              cup with the purchase of a seasonal drink. It’s packed with

              Your guests want to feel like they are getting a great deal. In
              fact, 39% of consumers believe direct incentives like money,
              discounts, or free swag can elevate the chances of referring a
              business.<b>Promotions</b> show guests you are grateful for them,
              and considerate of their hard-earned money.
            </p>
            <p>
              While you may not want your brand identity to scream, “discount!”
              you still want to consider implementing promotions throughout the
              course of the year, so that your guests can shop and receive
              services with a little more ease (and a little less budgeting).

              Promotions are also a proven and effective way to drive your
              marketing campaigns. You have a million things that you want to
              say to your guest, but how do you convince them to open your email
              or SMS communication? If you can’t offer a promotion that makes
              them pause and consider purchasing, your open rates will likely
              take a nosedive.

              Traditional marketing methods include for example newspaper
              advertising, flyers, or mailers. While these can all be effective
              in attracting new guests, they can also be costly, difficult to
              track, and hard to target. Personalized, retention-focused
              marketing programs help you get more from your existing guests.
              You'll find that there is a significant amount of revenue to tap
              into, but only if you put proper campaigns in place.

            <p class="mb-0">
              You can divide your guest base by segments, and target groups
              based on your individual goals. Let us look at some examples:

              <b>Personalized marketing</b> is more cost effective because it
              involves grouping guests based on buying patterns and preferences
              to determine what offers are relevant. It also helps you to avoid
              costly mistakes, like sending a coupon for a beard trim to women.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately, these campaigns enable you to deepen guest engagement
              and loyalty.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the help of Zenoti software, you can also track the results
              of these campaigns. For example, you can see the number of emails
              or SMS messages that were delivered to guests, the percentage of
              opened emails compared to delivered emails or the percentage of
              clicked emails compared to opened emails.

              Imagine this: you visit a bank to ask for a loan, offering a
              compelling business plan that focuses on guest service, marketing,
              and innovation. Then, the loan officer looks at you and asks,
              “what guarantee do you have that your guests will return?” Without
              a rebooking percentage, you have nothing to offer. This metric is
              crucial, and it’s often overlooked.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>“Rebooking”</b> refers to the number of invoices rebooked for
              any future date on the same day as the service, or number of
              invoices serviced. In other words, the percentage of invoices
              where guests make their next booking on the same day as their
              appointment.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              Guests may rebook at the end of their service, online when they
              get home, or call later that day. "Saving the date” with their
              guest service providers ensures future business and lessens the
              risk of guests bouncing to competitors.

              The cost of losing a member of your team can add up to thousands
              of dollars. Even more frightening, 76% of guests confessed to
              feeling more loyal to their service provider than to the business,
              so the odds of retaining a guest if their service provider decides
              to leave are less than 25%.

              Next time you detect a red flag for a high performing or
              influential team member churn risk, act fast. While it doesn’t
              only hurt morale in your salon, it also impacts your business.

              Furthermore, it’s important to take the time to determine what
              your action plan will be when turnover does occur so that you can
              be proactive and not reactive.

                  Spas and salons survive on repeat business from regular
                  guests. These guests provide predictable revenue and help you
                  meet monthly revenue targets. And since you can’t rely on
                  finding new guests every month, it’s important to do what it
                  takes to hold on to the guests you have.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The cost of not retaining guests is enormous. When you lose
                  guests, you not only lose revenue — you also increase profits
                  for your competition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The good news is that you can strengthen your guest retention
                  rate by implementing the business strategies outlined in this
                  course.
