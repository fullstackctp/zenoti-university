                            Packages are a terrific way to upsell to your customer and ensure future visits for your
                            business. For example, if a guest comes in for a facial, the receptionist could inform them
                            that a package is available that includes the facial plus a manicure for only a little more
                            than the cost of just the facial. Odds are the guest will most likely try the package.

                            otherwise spent. A guest who regularly comes in for a facial, pedicure and manicure would
                            spend less than they expected by taking advantage of the package.

                            creating a program. At each one, you should ask yourself a series of questions so that you
                            can be proactive and avoid any delays at the time of launch. We’ve outlined these below.

                                Tip: Consider how many services you would need to provide at the discounted rate to
                                generate your current revenue. Is that number of services feasible, or a stretch? If it
                                doesn’t seem realistic, you should reconsider the discount.
