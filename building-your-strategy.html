                    In 2021, to be a successful business you must have an online
                    presence. This can be a simple website, Facebook page,
                    and/or Instagram account, or it can stretch across multiple
                    channels and include an in-depth professionally created
                    website.

                    Digital marketing has many benefits, including reaching a
                    wider audience, targeting specific users, and capabilities
                    for future learning. With platforms like
                    Zenoti, where all your data is centrally located, you can measure
                    the effectiveness of your marketing campaign in a few easy
                    clicks.

                  <p>
                    One of the most beneficial attributes of digital marketing
                    is that it is interactive. You do not need Cover Girl sized budgets
                     for your marketing spend or corporate
                    executives to run a successful campaign. If your ideal
                    customer gets all of their recommendations from Instagram,
                    then that’s a great place to start. You don’t have to be
                    everywhere or in every medium. Meet people where they’re at,
                    and engage, engage, engage with them. Digital marketing is
                    not passive, you connect with your clients through engagement. 
                    Aim to provide education, inspiration, and entertainment.

                    The beauty brand, valued at
                      $1.2 billion, provides education and tips on Instagram
                    that their customers can use. This positions the brand as a
                    knowledge expert while boosting brand awareness and keeping

                    bob popular, the name evokes a feeling of heritage,
                    timeless, and classic style. His notoriety came from working
                    with celebrity clients and, back in the 1950s, he didn’t
