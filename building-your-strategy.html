                    In 2021, to be a successful business you must have an online
                    presence. This can be a simple website, Facebook page,
                    and/or Instagram account, or it can stretch across multiple
                    channels and include an in-depth professionally created

                    Digital marketing has many benefits, including reaching a
                    wider audience, targeting specific users, and capabilities
                    for future learning. With platforms like

                      >Zenoti</a

                    One of the most beneficial attributes of digital marketing
                    is that it is interactive. You don’t have to have Cover Girl
                    size budgets for your marketing spend or corporate
                    executives to run a successful campaign. If your ideal
                    customer gets all of their recommendations from Instagram,
                    then that’s a great place to start. You don’t have to be
                    everywhere or in every medium. Meet people where they’re at,
                    and engage, engage, engage with them. Digital marketing is
                    not passive,
