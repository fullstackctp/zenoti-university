              <p>
                In today’s digital world you are continuously competing for
                your customer’s attention and loyalty. With data and
                segmentation technologies, your competitors are able to target
                your customer base with ads across their social media and
                search channels at any time of the day. A loyalty program
                encourages customers to ignore these temptations by showing
                them how valued they are at your brand.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're all human and naturally enjoy a little recognition every
                now and then. If a customer comes back to your salon over and
                over, they’ll undoubtedly appreciate a little thank you or
                reward. Recognizing these customers may be easy if you are a
                small single center but as your brand grows and you hire more
                team members this can get tricky.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hence, having a clearly defined program which gives out loyalty
                points towards products or services is a simple, yet highly
                effective way of showing this appreciation. The key with
                giving points is that your most loyal customers are the ones
                who collect the most points and the occasional guest won’t
                accumulate many. The whole purpose of this model is to reward
                your best customers - after all the data shows these are most
                profitable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond just thanking customers for their loyalty, the program
                does serve other purposes. You are also able to collect
                information on their preferences, likes and dislikes, and
                personal information which helps you to build a tailored,
                personalized experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, when the triggers for them to leave do occur – like a new
                salon in the neighborhood or the departure of their favorite
                employee– you don’t immediately lose them. These customers
                will continue to be loyal to your brand since they are
                incentivized to continue earning and redeeming points.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-0">So, in essence having a loyalty program:</p>
              <!-- <ul
                class="padding-left-ul  mb-0"
                style="padding-left: 2rem !important"
              >
              <li>Increases customer retention by rewarding repeat appointments and making guests feel special</li>
              <li>Gives you the space to handle situations where you might lose your “most loyal” customers</li>
              <li>Provides you with valuable data to learn from and grow the business  </li>
              <li>Saves you money on having to market to new customers </li>
              <li>Boosts profits as loyal customers spend more</li>
              <li>Attracts new customers who want to get involved in the program </li>
              <li>Nurtures your relationships and communication with customers </li>
              </ul> -->
