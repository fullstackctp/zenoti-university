                    You’ve invested dozens of hours and hundreds of dollars creating an ad campaign targeted at all the
                    keywords your research showed you rank highly in search engines, but you’re not getting any results
                    and your budget is quickly running out. So, what is it you’re doing wrong?

                    Before implementing any customer acquisition strategy, it’s important to spend time gaining a full
                    understanding of who exactly the individuals that you want to target are. This is what will help you
                    stand out against the competition and catch the eye of the right guest that is looking to book their
                    next salon or spa appointment.

                    When you have this awareness of the ideal customer, you can make the right decisions on factors such
                    as messaging and media and ultimately achieve the best results.

            As a good starting point, it may help you to build out a few personas of your current customers and do some
            market research. Your providers know their guests inside and out, after all they spend all day interacting
            with them, so get the whole team involved and make it a collaborative, fun process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you understand who your current customer is, what value you provide to them, and their unique needs,
            you can use this knowledge to build an effective strategy for attracting new customers.

            Having insights into your target audience enables you to prioritize the strategies and channels that will
            market most effectively to them. This is critical for ensuring you get the best possible return on your
            investment (ROI). It also means that you are using the right language and communication methods to establish
            and build relationships with them and can personalize these interactions to their needs for best impact.
