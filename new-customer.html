                      You’ve invested dozens of hours and hundreds of dollars creating an ad campaign targeted at all the keywords your research showed you rank highly in search engines, but you’re not getting any results and your budget is quickly running out. So, what is it you’re doing wrong?

                    <p>
                      Before implementing any customer acquisition strategy, it’s important to spend time gaining a full understanding of who exactly the individuals that you want to target are. This is what will help you stand out against the competition and catch the eye of the right guest that is looking to book their next salon or spa appointment.

              As a good starting point, it may help you to build out a few personas of your current customers and do some market research. Your providers know their guests inside and out, after all they spend all day interacting with them, so get the whole team involved and make it a collaborative, fun process. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you understand who your current customer is, what value you provide to them, and their unique needs, you can use this knowledge to build an effective strategy for attracting new customers.
