            The saying goes, “What gets measured, gets managed,” but with all
            the responsibilities of owning or managing a salon, spa, or barber
            shop, how do you measure what’s really contributing to the success
            of your business?
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            That’s where business metrics come into play. Zenoti has a set of
            dashboards that report various important industry metrics. They
            provide you with the insights necessary to track trends and see
            the progress toward – or away – from your goals and benchmarks.
            These metrics help you gauge how your business is performing today
            and what the projections are for future performance.

            sales and collections are likely the business metrics you are most
            tuned into. In Zenoti, sales and collections are defined in the

                    Service sales are your bread and butter. If your service
                    collections are trending down, you may want to analyze
                    your service mix. For example, if you’re selling more
                    single process color services than highlights, your
                    average spend will be lower. Taking this data to your

          <p class="text-justify">
            When it comes to measuring the success of your business, you
            cannot overlook the importance of guest retention. Cultivating
            loyal guests helps increase collections, as Zenoti data shows 77%
            of revenue comes from guests who have visited more than four times
            in a year. It’s a numbers game. The more guests you retain, the
            more collections you earn.

                      Rebooking is a crucial as it’s a leading indicator
                      of future business and a key factor in building
                      guest retention rates. If your guest booked a

                      If this business metric is trending down, the best

                      of their service, while they are still in the
                      chair or treatment room. They can guide guests to
                      the customer mobile app, or (when permissions
                      allow) they can rebook their guest on their own

                      But it’s not just up to the service provider, your
                      business needs to create a culture of rebooking,

                  Implementing a plan to increase self-service bookings
                  clearly has its advantages. A great way to promote
                  self-service is to educate your staff on its many
                  benefits. They can then educate your guests about the
                  convenience and ease of using the online webstore,
                  customer mobile app, or guest kiosk (if applicable)
                  for booking appointments.

          <p class="text-justify">
            If you want to grow your business, you need to grow your customer
            base. Because of natural guest attrition, you’ll need to have
            various strategies for customer acquisition. The flip side of
            acquisition is retention. The average retention rate for salons
            and spas is 30%, so for every 100 new guests you acquire, on
            average, 70 of them will not return. High-performing salons and
            spas will set a higher benchmark for this metric, as they know
            letting 7 out of 10 guests slip through their fingers is not a
            sustainable way to grow their customer base.
          </p>

          <h3 class="mb-3">New Guest Visits</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Every spa, salon, or barbershop needs a constant flow of new
            clients if they are going thrive, let alone survive. The snapshot
            dashboard helps you stay on top of this important metric by
            tracking your New Guest Visits.

                  <b>New Guest Visits</b> is measured as the number of visits for

            Knowing the business metric for new guest visits, which is shown
            in the <i>Your Guests Snapshot</i> section, is vital for
            understanding your business growth.

          </div>
          <p class="text-justify mt-3">
            For example, if you are averaging 50 new guests a month, you can
            expect a total of 600 new guests over the course of a year.
            Knowing the average rate of retention is 30%, you can calculate
            your projected growth to be 180 new guests. That number can then
            be compared to previous years to determine if your customer base
            is growing, stagnant, or decreasing.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Once you know how many new guests are visiting, you can establish
            an action plan based on your needs. Whether the count is up or
            down, you need a plan in place.
          </p>
          <h3 class="mb-3">Referral Program</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">
            After making a push for new guests and having solid retention
            strategies in place, you will want to have a defined referral
            program up and running. A referral program is a great way to
            empower your existing clientele to help you expand your customer
            base. It makes sense that your loyal guests would have family and
            friends that are also aligned with your brand values and
            offerings.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            As a customer base expansion tactic, a referral program can be
            both rewarding for your guests and affordable for you. Even when
            the acquisition costs include a reward for the referring guest and
            their referred friend, it will likely be much less expensive than
            the cost of other marketing efforts.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">The Zenoti Referral Reward Program allows your business to leverage this key strategy
            for growing your clientele, making it easy for your existing guests to share a referral code with friends
            and family using a text message. For more details, go to "Referral Reward Program in a Nutshell" in the

            Once you’ve done the work to get guests in your shop and have
            delivered exceptional guest experience to retain them, you can
            build on that trusted relationship by recommending service
            enhancements and retail products. Doing this adds value to their
            experience, can extend their service results, and strengthens
            their trust in you. All of which can lead to an increase in their
            spend with your business.

            It’s no secret beauty and wellness businesses are always looking
            to increase revenue. And a surefire way to do that is to increase
            your average spend. Also known as average ticket, increasing the
            amount your guests spend at each visit or over a set course of
            time (e.g., yearly) is a growth metric you will want to closely
            monitor and track.

            Another key metric for managing future success is how well your
            business optimizes its provider utilization. Nobody wants empty
            appointment books. It’s unmotivating for the service providers and
            bad for business. So this business metric should be monitored
            closely.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">To maximize revenue, your employees should be providing services during all their
            available hours. Granted,
            a 100% utilization rate may not be realistic, but high performing salons and spas commit to getting as close
            as possible to a perfect percentage.</p>

            To combat low service provider utilization, you can increase your
