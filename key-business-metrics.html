            The saying goes, “What gets measured, gets managed,” but with all the responsibilities of owning or managing
            a salon,
            spa, or barber shop, how do you measure what’s really contributing to the success of your business?
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">That’s where business metrics come into play. Zenoti has a set of dashboards that
            report various important industry metrics.
            They provide you with the insights necessary to track trends and see the progress toward – or away – from
            your goals and benchmarks.
            These metrics help you gauge how your business is performing today and what the projections are for future
            performance.

            In Zenoti, sales and collections differ in two main ways:</p>

              <b>Collections</b> are reported for open or closed invoices, and the collections amount will include

                    For example, if you’re selling more single process color services than highlights, your average
                    spend will be lower.

          <p class="text-justify">When it comes to measuring the success of your business, you cannot overlook the
            importance of guest retention.
            Cultivating loyal guests helps increase collections, as Zenoti data shows 77% of revenue comes from guests
            who have visited more
            than four times in a year.
            It’s a numbers game. The more guests you retain, the more collections you earn.</p>

                Guest retention is measured by the percentage of new and repeat guests that had a service and are booked

                            or treatment room. They can guide guests
                            to the customer mobile app,

                          <p class="text-justify">But it’s not just up to the service provider, your business needs to

          <h2 class="mb-3">Expanding Customer Base</h2>
          <p class="text-justify">If you want to grow your business, you need to grow your customer base. Because of
            natural guest attrition,
            you’ll need to have various strategies for customer acquisition. The flip side of acquisition is retention.
            The average retention rate for salons and spas is 30%, so for every 100 new guests you acquire, on average,
            70 of them will not return.
            High-performing salons and spas will set a higher benchmark for this metric,
            as they know letting 7 out of 10 guests slip through their fingers is not a sustainable way to grow their
            customer base.</p>

              <strong>
                New Guest Visits is measured as the number of visits for guests who do not
                have a prior ‘visit’ on any previous day.
              </strong>
            </p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-justify"> Knowing the business metric for new guest visits, which is shown in the <i>Your
              Guests Snapshot</i> section, is vital for understanding your business growth.</p>

          <p class="text-justify mt-3">For example, if you are averaging 50 new guests a month,
            you can expect a total of 600 new guests over the course of a year. Knowing the average rate of retention is
            30%,
            you can calculate your projected growth to be 180 new guests.
            That number can then be compared to previous years to determine if your customer base is growing, stagnant,
            or decreasing. </p>
          <p class="text-justify">Once you know how many new guests are visiting, you can establish an action plan based
            on your needs. Whether the count is up or down, you need a plan in place.</p>

          <h2 class="mb-3">Increasing Average Spend </h2>
          <p>Once you’ve done the work to get guests in your shop and have delivered an exceptional guest experience to
            retain them,
            it’s important to maximize the amount they spend at each visit with service enhancements and retail
            recommendations.
            This business metric is found in the Your Guests Snapshot section,</p>
          <div class="text-center w-100 mb-3">
            <img src="img/pie_graph.png" class="img-responsive img-fluid w-80" />
          </div>
          <p>An increase in average spend per visit means your guests had higher invoice totals for any given day
            compared to the prior reporting period.</p>
          <div class="callout">
            <p>
              <strong>
                Average spend is calculated as the day’s final invoice total (includes discounts/excludes taxes) divided
                by the number of visits.
              </strong>
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Increasing the average spend is not only a fantastic way to drive sales, it also strengthens the guest
            experience and increases brand loyalty.
          </p>
          <h2 class="mb-3">Product to Service Ratio</h2>
          <p>An obvious way to increase average spend is to sell retail products.
            The percentage of guests that purchase retail product along with paying for a service is known as the
            product to service ratio.</p>
          <div class="callout">
            <p>
              <strong>
                Product to service ratio is calculated as the number of closed invoices that include at least one
                service and one product divided by the number of closed invoices with at least one service (excludes
                refunds). </strong>
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>In the <i>Your Locations Snapshot</i> section of the dashboard, the product to service ratio for each of
            your centers is listed. Tracking this business metric on a regular basis will help you meet and exceed your
            average spend benchmarks.</p>

          <div class="text-center w-100 mb-3">
            <img src="img/chart_table.png" class="img-responsive img-fluid w-100" />
          </div>

          <p>
            While being obvious, it’s not always easy for your staff to increase this ratio. This may be due to a lack
            of product knowledge or being uncomfortable in a sales role, but consistently attaching products to your
            services is a major win for your business.
          </p>
          <ul style="padding-left: 2rem !important">
            <li class="text-justify">
              The way to overcome sales hesitation is education. To do this, ensure your service providers have initial
              and ongoing product training. It’s also important that your front desk staff can identify product features
              and benefits.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              With a solid understanding of your product mix, your providers can “tell” rather than “sell”. Educating
              clients about the products they should be using to maintain their style or results should automatically be
              part of the conversation they have during their time with a guest. </li>

          <h2 class="mb-3">Optimizing Utilization</h2>
          <p>Another key metric for managing future success is how well your business optimizes its provider
            utilization. Nobody wants empty appointment books. It’s unmotivating for the service providers and bad for
            business. So this business metric should be monitored closely.
          </p>
          <p>This important business metric is tracked in the <i>Your Providers Snapshot</i> section of the dashboard,
            where you can see utilization percentages for the selected timeframe and for the next two weeks.</p>

            To combat low service provider utilization, you can increase your efforts on rebooking. Successfully
            rebooking leads to future scheduled appointments and higher utilization.
          </p>
          <p>Options to try when utilization is low for the next two weeks include:</p>
          <ul style="padding-left: 2rem !important">
            <li class="text-justify">
              Launching a marketing campaign to boost last minute bookings.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Adjusting the number of providers you have scheduled to avoid having technicians on the floor without
              clients.
            </li>

          </ul>
          <p>
            Keep in mind, frequent changes to your regular schedule can lead to employee discontent. The better option
            is to optimize your marketing efforts and build a culture of rebooking.

                If your upcoming utilization is higher than expected, you may want to investigate what’s contributing to
                the spike.
                For instance, the school prom may be why there are so many “updo” appointments. No matter the reason,
                you’ll want to capitalize on the heavy traffic. In this case, you may want to add stylists (and makeup
                artists)
                to make the most of the occasion.
