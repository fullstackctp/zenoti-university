                  reminded of another guest who hasn’t been back for a while?

                Getting new clients is the lifeblood of any business, so if
                your aim is to grow then you need to grow your guest base.
                Even if you have the most loyal customers in the world who
                regularly rebook appointments and visit for treatments, you
                won’t see growth unless new guests are also coming in.
                Ultimately, guest count is a numbers game. The more guests you
                have, the more opportunities there are for them to invest in
                your services, products and brand - which equates to a growing
                profit.

          <p>
            The same theory goes for your guest base. You cannot reach your
            goals by remaining content with the guests you once earned. Seek
            growth by tapping into guests that have yet to consider your
            business for their needs.

                    of who exactly the individuals that you want to target
                    are. This is what will help you stand out against the

            In order to build an effective strategy to generate new customers,

            As a good starting point, it may help you to build out a few
            personas of your current customers and do some market research.
            Your providers know their guests inside and out, after all they
            spend all day interacting with them, so get the whole team
            involved and make it a collaborative, fun process.

          <p>
            Once you understand who your current customer is, what value you
            provide to them, and their unique needs, you can use this
            knowledge to build an effective strategy for attracting new
            customers.

            Today’s gift is tomorrow’s guest. And today’s gift is, of course,
            a gift card! Gift card sales are a wonderful indicator of future

          <ul style="padding-left: 2rem !important">
            <li>
              In 2019, U.S. guests spent $190 billion dollars (about $580 per
              person) on gift card purchases.
            </li>
            <li>
              70% of all U.S. consumers claim to have bought a gift card as a
              present during a holiday season.
            </li>
            <li>
              65% of guests who receive a gift card spend 40% more than the
              card value.
            </li>
            <li>
              Brands who offer Zenoti gift cards see over 180% jump in gift
              card revenue during holiday months.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Not only is this a significant amount of revenue to miss out on if
            you don’t sell gift cards, but research shows they actually
            influence the future of your brand too. This is because 11% of
            guests aged 18 to 34 are more likely to visit a brand they
            wouldn’t otherwise visit because they have received gift card.

          <p>
            Let's take the COVID-19 pandemic as an example. This unique and
            unprecedented situation drastically increased global demand for
            safe, touchless technology solutions that enabled businesses to
            stay open and serving guests. The brands that were able to not
            only successfully implement these solutions but market them so
            that existing and potential new guests were aware of them, were
            those who ensured success through COVID.
          </p>
          <p>
            By marketing a solution to a problem and highlighting what set
            them apart from competitors, in this case touchless technology,
            new guests opted for these service providers as a safe option for
            their needs.

            Modern guests take their time when choosing which brand to visit.
            Accessing your website enables them to browse without feeling as
            if they are imposing on a receptionist. And the reality is, your
            front desk team is probably unable to spend ten minutes speaking
            with every guest that calls to book.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this in mind, your website still needs to replicate the same
            extraordinary experience the guest would get when speaking with
            the front desk or entering your center. What does the guest see?
            Is there a flow? Is there an intuitive user experience? Is it
            clear where they should be going to access what they’re looking
            for? If your website is not guest centric, chances are they will
            not take the time to learn if your salon or spa is guest centric.

          <p>
            Finally, keep in mind that different generations have different
            opinions and behaviors when it comes to using the internet.
            Perhaps teenagers aren’t your target demographic currently, but
            they are your future business. So, remember that the services and
            programs that they are offered now will affect your ability to
            gain their loyalty.

            You've built a brand you are passionate about and that represents
            your values and beliefs. Therefore, it’s natural that your salon
            or spa would then attract an audience of like-minded individuals
            who love to visit because they are also aligned with your brand
            values and ethos.

            Well, with a referral strategy you can do exactly this! All you

            Implementing a referral program may be an easy solution for an
            expensive problem. If your guests are thinking about referring
            their friends and family, then give them a push to do so! It’s not
            just one extra guest you can expect to meet, it’s almost triple
            that since research shows that every referrer makes an average of
            2.68 referrals. Don’t forget, the guests referred to your business
            will spend more in their lifetime of conducting business with you
            than guests who were not referred.
