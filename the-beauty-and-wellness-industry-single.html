                <p class="mt-3">
                  Websites may have once just been a digital business card but
                  not anymore. Today, websites represent your entire brand
                  identity. It is your business portfolio, advertising, and
                  receptionist all rolled into one.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Therefore, the time and energy you invest in building a
                  strong online presence can really help to propel your
                  business to the next level. And on the other hand, it can
                  really hinder your growth and customer acquisition if it is
                  not representative of your brand or delivers a negative user
                  experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The beauty and wellness industry is not exempt to the
                  importance of having an online presence. In fact, because we
                  are appointment based and sell a look, our web presence may
                  be most important of all.

                        Across Zenoti customers, 29% of online booked
                        appointments are from new guests.

                  Your website serves as your greatest tool for tapping into
                  an entirely new audience base of prospective guests.
                  Consider your experience from working at the front desk.
                  Phone interactions with new guests typically take longer
                  than conversations with an existing guest. This is because
                  new visitors have questions (understandably so!) and for
                  that reason like to access a website. A website enables them
                  to have a browse and get a feel for the brand before they
                  make the decision about whether it’s a good fit for them and
                  their needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once your website has caught their attention, they can take
                  their time exploring without feeling like they are imposing
                  on anyone or pressured to make a commitment. Unlike calling
                  a receptionist, who may only have three minutes to book an
                  appointment, a guest accessing your website and online
                  booking platform has no time limit to shopping around. And
                  that is a good thing!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Besides, do your receptionists really have time to talk on
                  the phone with every new guest?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your website is essentially a taste of your business, and
                  the information on your page are your samples. They are
                  being consumed by a lot of people, and you want to pass the
                  test.

                The experience a guest has with your website is even more
                important than the experience that they have in your center.
                This is because
                <b>your website is open to the world 24 hours a day, 7 days a
                  week</b>. This means it has the capability to reach more people which
                is a great thing for your brand awareness, but have you ever
                stopped to consider what first impression those visitors get
                when they land on your home page?

              <p>
                Within the first fifteen seconds the user needs to know what
                you do and be convinced that you’re the best at it. Whether
                you are trying to attract business executives, busy parents,
                or savvy college students, you will not get far if your
                website experience is poor.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your website is frustrating, the guest is not going to
                chance walking through your doors. If the experience is
                seamless and guest friendly, they will associate your salon
                with being guest centric as well.
              </p>
              <p>

                <li>
                  Can they see what you’ve curated on your social media?
                </li>
                <li>
                  If guests are asking questions or providing feedback, are
                  you responding so that your community can see your business
                  is responsible and provides follow-through?
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Digital interactions should mirror your in-person
                interactions. You would never think to not call an upset guest
                back, so why would you leave someone hanging online?
              </p>
              <p class="mb-0">
                Finally, prospective guests want to see your photo gallery. If
                you do not have one, that can be a huge red flag. You sell a
                look, whether it is clear skin, beautiful nails, or healthy
                hair, if you are not showcasing your photos on your website,
                you are not promoting what it is that you do best.

                anywhere with the click of a button. Without worrying if their

                are out of breath from having just got off the treadmill, like
                you would with a phone call. Almost half of individuals prefer

                Online booking is also proven to improve visit frequency.
                Amongst Zenoti customers, guests who book an appointment
                online visit 1 more time per year, or book 10 days sooner than
                guests who book via phone. One visit may not seem like a lot,
                but multiply that by the number of different guests that you
                see in a year, and you are talking about serious revenue.

              <p>
                Additionally, online booking significantly helps to reduce the
                number of no-shows that affect your business. Particularly if
                you request credit card information to finalize the booking.
                Through their partnership with Zenoti, a leading salon
                customer decreased no-show appointments by 35%, recapturing a
                little over 1/3 of their bookable appointment blocks.

                Your website IS your marketing tool. It is a simple and
                effective way to showcase everything that you want your guests
                (current and future) to be aware of. It is your opportunity to
                brag about why you are the best and how the value of being a
                guest of yours is better than the competition.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your website is a great place to share what is new and fresh
                about your business. Everything from new services, new service
                providers, new locations, new partnerships, and new products
                can be easily viewed and accessed. Keeping your guests in the
                loop of what is fresh within your company will keep your
                business new and exciting.

                    Your website has a lot of real estate, and that space is
                    best utilized when it features some of your most popular
                    promotions and campaigns.

                Whether you are highlighting your loyalty program,
                Refer-a-Friend campaign, or gift card promotion, you are
                appealing to the customer’s desire to save money and feel like
                they are a part of something. In the eyes of your guests there

                A successful marketing announcement calls for an action.
                “Click here” or “buy now” buttons make it convenient for
                guests and generate sales for your business. Utilizing
                banners, side panels, and imbedded URLs ensures that the guest
                on your website knows there is an opportunity to maximize upon
                their appointment value.

                    One of the best advantages of marketing online is that it
                    is more cost-effective than traditional marketing.

              <p>
                With traditional marketing you are paying to print and
                distribute marketing materials. Every time you run a new
                promotion, update your service menu or revamp a program you
                must invest in reprinting new materials. When marketing on
                your website it is as simple as removing one image and
                replacing it with another, with little turnaround time. This
                means you can rest easy knowing your guests have access to
                updated information and are aware of current promotions and
                offerings.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember, your website is accessible to anyone, at any time.
                Prospective guests are viewing your website and if they like
                what they see they can request to connect with your business.
                Perhaps they enter their email address to be included in
                future communications from your salon or spa. Voila! They are
                now on your mailing list, even if they have never received a
                service from you. By making sure that prospective guests have
                a way to connect with you, you capture them for the future.

                return for the product is slim. By integrating e-commerce to

            Once you’ve launched your website, you have access to data which
            can help you to better understand how it is performing. You’ll
            have insights into most visited pages and where people are

            “Hot” areas gained the most traffic, guests either clicked,
            stopped scrolling, or spent an extended time on a particular page
            or part of your website. “Cold” areas are those where a guest
            spent the least amount of time, they did not effectively capture
            guest attention. Knowing how your website performs helps you to
            find answers on how to get site visitors to convert to purchasing
            and/or booking.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            Website performance insights can also tell you a lot about your
            online booking process. You can identify at which point in the
            online experience the guest dropped off. To do this consider these
            steps:
          </p>
          <!-- img -->
          <div class="imgCardleverage section-padding-2">
            <img src="img/placeholder.png" class="img-responsive w-100" />
          </div>
          <!-- end -->
          <p class="mt-3">
            Analyzing each step of the booking process highlights where
            individuals are dropping off (which points to this step needing
            improvement) and how many users started the process compared to
            the number of successful bookings. With this knowledge you can
            continue to enhance and improve your website, and your business.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are choosing to feature e-commerce on your website, you can
            also track the performance of product sales. Are your top sellers
            the same as those in-salon? Do the reviews reflect the number of
            sales? Of guests that purchased online, how many returned to
            purchase a second time?
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on the performance on the website you can determine what
            products guests are drawn to, even when a service provider is not
            there to make a recommendation. Perhaps those products deserve a
            spotlight in-salon?
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, website performance insights serve as the “fly on the
            wall”. You suddenly have visibility into success rates and can
            better determine which promotions drive the most business, which
            part of the booking process loses the most guests and how many of
            your appointments are booked online. By understanding how guests
            interact with your website, you can identify trends and optimize
            for further engagement.
