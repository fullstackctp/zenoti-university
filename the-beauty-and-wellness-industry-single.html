                <p class="mt-3 text-justify">
                  Websites may have once just been a digital business card but
                  not anymore. Today, websites represent your entire brand
                  identity. It is your business portfolio, advertising, and
                  receptionist all rolled into one.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                  Therefore, the time and energy you invest in building a
                  strong online presence can really help to propel your
                  business to the next level. And on the other hand, it can
                  really hinder your growth and customer acquisition if it is
                  not representative of your brand or delivers a negative user
                  experience.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                  The beauty and wellness industry is not exempt to the
                  importance of having an online presence. In fact, because we
                  are appointment based and sell a look, our web presence may
                  be most important of all.

                        Across Zenoti customers, 29% of online booked

                  Your website serves as your greatest tool for tapping into
                  an entirely new audience base of prospective guests.
                  Consider your experience from working at the front desk.
                  Phone interactions with new guests typically take longer
                  than conversations with an existing guest. This is because
                  new visitors have questions (understandably so!) and for
                  that reason like to access a website. A website enables them
                  to have a browse and get a feel for the brand before they
                  make the decision about whether it’s a good fit for them and
                  their needs.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                  Once your website has caught their attention, they can take
                  their time exploring without feeling like they are imposing
                  on anyone or pressured to make a commitment. Unlike calling
                  a receptionist, who may only have three minutes to book an
                  appointment, a guest accessing your website and online
                  booking platform has no time limit to shopping around. And
                  that is a good thing!
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                  Besides, do your receptionists really have time to talk on
                  the phone with every new guest?
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                  Your website is essentially a taste of your business, and
                  the information on your page are your samples. They are
                  being consumed by a lot of people, and you want to pass the
                  test.

                Within the first fifteen seconds the user needs to know what

                Finally, prospective guests want to see your photo gallery. If

              <p class="mt-3 text-justify">
                These days, online booking is an expectation. Guests want the
                convenience of being able to access the scheduler anytime,
                anywhere with the click of a button. Without worrying if their
                kids are screaming, traffic noises interfering or that they
                are out of breath from having just got off the treadmill, like
                you would with a phone call. Almost half of individuals prefer
                to make a booking outside of business hours. After all, we all
                think about our to-do list when we are falling asleep don’t
                we?

                Online booking is also proven to improve visit frequency.
                Amongst Zenoti customers, guests who book an appointment
                online visit 1 more time per year, or book 10 days sooner than
                guests who book via phone. One visit may not seem like a lot,
                but multiply that by the number of different guests that you
                see in a year, and you are talking about serious revenue.

              <p class="text-justify">
                Additionally, online booking significantly helps to reduce the
                number of no-shows that affect your business. Particularly if
                you request credit card information to finalize the booking.
                Through their partnership with Zenoti, a leading salon
                customer decreased no-show appointments by 35%, recapturing a
                little over 1/3 of their bookable appointment blocks.

                Utilizing banners, side panels, and imbedded URLs ensures that the guest

                replacing it with another, with little turnaround time. This
                means you can rest easy knowing your guests have access to

                Remember, your website is accessible to anyone, at any time.
                Prospective guests are viewing your website and if they like
                what they see they can request to connect with your business.
                Perhaps they enter their email address to be included in
                future communications from your salon or spa. Voila! They are
                now on your mailing list, even if they have never received a
                service from you. By making sure that prospective guests have
                a way to connect with you, you capture them for the future.

            spent the least amount of time, they did not effectively capture
            guest attention. Knowing how your website performs helps you to
            find answers on how to get site visitors to convert to purchasing
            and/or booking.

            Website performance insights can also tell you a lot about your
            online booking process. You can identify at which point in the
            online experience the guest dropped off. To do this consider these
            steps:

          <p>Where are guests dropping off in the online booking experience? </p>
          <p>Did they click on “book now” but fail to pick a date? </p>
          <p>Did they pick a date but fail to choose a time?</p>
          <p>Did they select a time but fail to pick a provider?</p>

          <p class="mt-3 text-justify">
            Analyzing each step of the booking process highlights where
            individuals are dropping off (which points to this step needing
            improvement) and how many users started the process compared to
            the number of successful bookings. With this knowledge you can
            continue to enhance and improve your website, and your business.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            If you are choosing to feature e-commerce on your website, you can
            also track the performance of product sales. Are your top sellers
            the same as those in-salon? Do the reviews reflect the number of
            sales? Of guests that purchased online, how many returned to
            purchase a second time?
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Based on the performance on the website you can determine what
            products guests are drawn to, even when a service provider is not
            there to make a recommendation. Perhaps those products deserve a
            spotlight in-salon?
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Overall, website performance insights serve as the “fly on the
            wall”. You suddenly have visibility into success rates and can
            better determine which promotions drive the most business, which
            part of the booking process loses the most guests and how many of
            your appointments are booked online. By understanding how guests
            interact with your website, you can identify trends and optimize
            for further engagement.
