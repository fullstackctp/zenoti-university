                        A few decades ago, if one of your guests didn’t like the service they received or an interaction
                        they had with your brand, you only risked them telling people in their immediate circle of
                        influence — their family and friends. In today’s digital world, however, reviews are now a quick
                        click away and are accessible anytime, anywhere, through multiple channels.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        One critical review has the potential to reach, and turn away, dozens, if not hundreds, of
                        potential guests. This can negatively affect your business and your brand before someone ever
                        sets foot in your spa or salon. That’s where the guest experience comes in. Creating a strong,
                        branded guest experience isn’t
                        just an integral part of your business — it’s the foundation of your success. A strong guest
                        experience supports all the key elements of your business and makes your guests
                        feel like VIPs at every interaction.

                        In the U.S. in 2014 there were 650,000 barbers, hairdressers, and cosmetologists. Schwartz
                        Cosmetics predicts that number will increase nearly 10% by 2024. So, even if you offer the best
                        haircuts, if the whole experience you give your guests doesn't exceed their expectations, then
                        they may not choose you a second time.

                        That’s exactly why it’s more important than ever for your guests to feel like they’ve received
                        the best experience possible.

                        A true guest experience starts with your creative marketing and personalized guest

                        The customer experience that you provide dictates your brand’s reputation. Having a bad
                        reputation is detrimental to your business. This is because negative reviews spread twice as
                        fast. So, even with recovery efforts, it will take twice as long to repair. Offering a five-star
                        service coupled with a five-star guest experience is the basis of building a strong reputation
                        and a strong business.

                        We already know it can be difficult to earn positive reviews. While guest feedback is an
                        important part of your business strategy, it shouldn’t be the driving factor behind building

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        It’s all about how you make your guests feel. For example, when someone carries a designer purse
                        or drives a luxury electric vehicle, they are choosing that brand because it makes them feel a
                        strong sense of pride whenever they use it. That’s exactly how you want your guests to feel
                        about you.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        When one of your guests are asked, “where do you go for your hair color?” you want them to glow
                        with pride while they excitedly share everything about your business. You want every single
                        guest to have confidence that they belong to a salon or spa that’s not only great at what it
                        does, but that also gives them that VIP treatment they’re craving. Then, and only then, will
                        your brand reputation take on a positive shape and begin to organically grow.

                        impacts every aspect of your business. Put this way, raving fans are your livelihood.

                        A proper consultation serves many purposes. It helps the service provider learn what the guest
                        feels that they need from the appointment and then aligns those goals with the services they
                        provide. But it also creates the perfect opportunity for service providers to make valuable
                        recommendations for enhancements. Not only will this give your guests a better experience, but
                        you’ll also get significantly more value from that appointment block.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Establish strong consultation practices that encourage your service providers to listen,
                        empathize, ask questions and provide solutions on how their guests can achieve their hair and
                        beauty goals. When your guests feel genuinely listened to, they will know without a doubt that
                        you have their best interests at heart. You will have invested your time, your talent and your
                        expertise with the guest. And in exchange, <b>they will invest in what you believe is best for
                            them.</b>

                        Consider your current consultation practices: If it only includes asking questions like, “What
                        are we doing today?” or, “Same thing as last time?” are you really meeting your guest’s needs?
                        Remember that the purpose of the consultation is to uncover their goal during this time that
                        they have with you. Try shifting away from generic, empty questions and engaging in open-ended
                        conversations that open the door for dialogue. For example, a question like, “Tell me about your
                        hair?” allows you to incorporate add-ons and product recommendations seamlessly throughout the
                        appointment.

                        Your guests want to be more than an appointment on your books. When you intentionally build a
                        rapport with your guests, you earn their trust, and in exchange they’re more receptive to your
                        recommendations. Whether those recommendations are enhanced services or products for
                        maintenance, they translate to a better experience for your guest, and add more value to the
                        appointment. The overall guest experience you offer, including the consultation, has a direct
                        effect on how much a guest will invest in you.

                        undervalued and overlooked when running a beauty or wellness business.

                        Promoting guest-centric programs, like memberships and loyalty rewards, are another great way to
                        increase retention. Guest loyalty will grow as they feel valued and are incentivized to choose
                        your business. It’s a win-win situation!
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Besides offering new ways for your guests to save money, you can also enhance guest experience
                        and increase retention by directly inviting the guest back in to see you. Not only does this
                        show them you enjoyed your time together and further strengthen relationships, but guests will
                        also start looking forward to spending more time with you in the future. Just as you would put a
                        wedding or a party in your calendar, you can save the date with your guest.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        If you want to improve guest retention, then the experience that you offer needs to be
                        prioritized just as much as the service that you provide. They could have received an amazing
                        massage, but if they didn’t feel valued for being there, the benefits of that massage are short
                        lived. But, once a guest feels that they are appreciated, a positive connection forms between
                        your business and that guest. And when that connection forms it becomes less about if they will
                        return and more about when they will return.

                        loyal guests, the major takeaway is that loyal guests are the foundation of your business
                        thriving beyond the present and into the future.

                        Whether you use an iPhone or an Android, drink Coke or Pepsi, drive a Dodge or Chevy, you are
                        practicing brand loyalty every time you use that company’s products. And, as a loyal member of a
                        brand, you unconsciously spend each day championing that business.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Your business has its own set of champions — guests who receive amazing services and experiences
                        and tell people about it. The level of training that you possess, the friendlier that you are,
                        the more that you can surprise and delight, the more guest champions you will create. This is
                        extremely important because your champion guests are your marketing troops, and they do some of
                        the most valuable work for your business.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Marketing to a prospective guest can cost up to 5 times more than existing guests (Forbes). But
                        not if you’re encouraging current guests to be your guest champions. If the service they
                        received is top notch and the experience was superb, your guests will talk about it, post about
                        it, or leave a flattering review.
