              You know the guests who walk through your door and know exactly
              where to go? The ones who see you and immediately call you by your
              name. Those who bring you a treat when they come for their visit
              or a small gift during the holidays.

              When you see the smile on their face, hear the sincere “I love
              it!”, and read the shout-out on social media attached to their
              smiling selfie, you’re instantly reminded why you do what you do.
              <b>That’s guest retention at it’s best!</b>

            <p>
              It’s your goal to nurture these guest relationships and keep them
              coming back — but doing so takes more than exemplary service
              alone. So, to help, we’ve developed a course that provides an
              overview of the key elements of guest loyalty, along with six
              proven ways that you can effectively retain your guests.

                  Did you know that repeat business from happy guests is the
                  biggest contributor to revenue? Our customer data shows that
                  over 77% of a spa or salon’s revenue comes from guests who
                  have visited over four times in a year. Cultivating their
                  loyalty and maximizing their participation in your programs
                  and offerings is important to your business. The more that you
                  can drive their frequency of visit, and get them involved in
                  what you offer, the more committed they'll be to your brand.

                  You worked hard to build your current guest base, and it
                  likely wasn’t cheap to do so. In fact, it can cost 5x more to
                  acquire a new guest than to retain an existing one. That's why
                  your goal should be to keep clients loyal by offering
                  exemplary guest service and programs they’ll find valuable.
                  With only 30% of guests likely to return after their first
                  visit, it’s essential you employ tools that guarantee their
                  return.

              How to Build a Foundation for Guest Retention
            </h2>
            <p class="section-padding-3">
              You can have the friendliest team members, a gorgeous salon, and
              the best technology, but if one element in particular is missing,
              you will not have a strong foundation for retaining your guest
              base.
              <b>The crucial element is TRUST.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Trust is earned when actions meet words. Your current guests are
              returning because you earned their trust through the service you
              provide and the quality of the recommendations you give. And they
              demonstrate this appreciation by rebooking, referring, trying new
              services and products, and generally… spending more money.
            </p>
            <p>
              Building the foundation of trust and creating impressive guest
              retention rates can be accomplished with an Always/Never approach.
              See below for the details!

                        tried-and-true way to measure the quality and

                          remember the exact service you provided, but they will
                          always remember the way you made them feel. Which
                          means, your business must always deliver an end-to-end
                          experience that leaves your guests delighted
                          throughout their time at your salon or spa. The time
                          it takes to create a client experience cycle and train
                          your staff to consistently deliver it is well worth
                          the effort. Never leave this to chance!

              It would be simple if success in the beauty and wellness industry
              relied solely on technical and interpersonal skills. But the fact

              New guests often come in with coupons or expecting a discount. They pay less than your loyal guests at checkout, and then 7 out of 10 times, you never see them again.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your regular guests follow healthy habits like purchasing retail and rebooking their appointments — but they frequently pay full price and end up feeling under appreciated.

            <p>
              An effective loyalty program keeps guests coming back. They can be as simple or as robust as you want. A business can reward guests based on their spend amounts or certain behaviors, such as providing feedback, rebooking an appointment, or referring a friend.

              Amazon Prime, Costco, and Walmart are just a few big players in
              the membership game. They've probably already convinced you that
              being a member with their brand has massive perks — whether it’s
              free shipping, same day delivery, or discounts on gas. These
              brands become top of mind because there’s extra value in shopping
              there. For the businesses, there’s even more value from your
              membership enrollment.
            </p>
            <p>
              A spa or salon membership program is an ongoing promotion for
              guests. Once a guest enrolls in your program, they receive special
              benefits associated with their membership. That might be discounts
              on services or products or credits toward a free service.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>
                Memberships are a powerful way for you to increase average
                spend, boost visit frequency, and encourage guests to try new
                services. They offer a simple, automated way to upsell!
              </b>
            </p>
            <p>
              The real power of a membership program takes place when it is
              integrated with business operations software, like Zenoti. The
              automation and customizations are many with an integration. Take
              marketing, for example. You can share unique offers with all your
              members at once when using an integrated marketing module.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you modernize your membership program, you'll save time for
              your staff and see a direct result on your bottom line.

              Let’s think about Starbucks. How many times have you been able to
              find a coupon before you hit the drive-through for your latte?
              Probably never.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now think about Starbucks on a Thursday afternoon when it’s BOGO
              Happy Hour or the first Friday in November when they are gifting a
              free holiday cup with the purchase of a seasonal drink. It’s
              packed with customers, with lines around the building. Those are
              successful promotions!
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>
                Your guests want to feel like they are getting a great deal, and
                promotions show them you are grateful for business and
                considerate of their hard-earned money.
              </b>
              In fact, 39% of consumers say incentives like cashback, discounts,
              or free swag increase the chances they’ll refer your business to
              others.
            </p>
            <p>
              While you may not want your brand identity to scream, “Discount!”,
              you still want to consider implementing promotions throughout the
              course of the year, so your guests can shop and receive services
              with a little more ease (and a little less budgeting).

              Businesses need marketing. Even the world’s most successful
              companies invest extraordinary amounts in their marketing efforts
              to continually increase their customer base and entice existing
              customers. Your guests may need a push or a reminder to return for
              their next service, especially when there are so many other
              competing thoughts and priorities in their lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Traditional marketing methods include newspaper advertising,
              flyers, or mailers. While these can all be effective in attracting
              new guests, they can also be costly, difficult to track, and hard
              to target.
              <b
                >Personalized, retention-focused marketing programs help you get
                more from your existing guests. </b
              >You'll find there is a significant amount of revenue to tap into,
              but only if you put the right campaigns in place.
            </p>
            <p>
              The key to driving the right campaign
              <i class="fst-italic">
                > to the right people > at the right time </i
              >is to divide your guest base into segments and target groups.
              Depending on the goals for your campaign, you can target certain
              promotions to certain segments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Personalized marketing is more cost effective because it involves
              grouping guests based on buying patterns and preferences to
              determine what offers are relevant. It also helps you to avoid
              costly mistakes, like sending a coupon for a beard trim to women.
              Yikes!
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately, these campaigns enable you to deepen guest engagement
              and loyalty.

              A closer look at any high-performing spa or salon will reveal they
              have a strong commitment to rebooking. And not just at the front
              desk, but also with the service providers. Obviously, rebooking is
              good for your business, but it also benefits your clients in a big
              way. Of course, they want to look their best or maintain their
              improved well-being, but to do that they need your rebooking
              recommendations. If it helps to get over your hesitancy, think of
              it as “educating the client” on why it’s best for them to make
              their next appointment before they leave the shop.

              <p class="mt-3">
                Something as important as rebooking deserves more than a simple,
                “Would you like to rebook?” It’s just too easy for your clients
                to reply, “No thanks.” The better option is to use a script that
                focuses on the benefits of booking before they leave. Prepping a
                script and practicing with your team is worth it, as it’s
                estimated that clients who rebook visit about 50% more often
                than those who don’t.

                  A culture of rebooking means every guest gets encouraged to
                  rebook after every appointment. Don’t wing it!

                  </div>
                  Think of rebooking as “educating” the client on how to
                  maintain their results, not as “selling” them on their next
                  appointment.

                  Provide a specific date and time when recommending their next
                  appointment, rather than an open-ended, “What day works for
                  you?”

                  Offer incentives to guests, like additional loyalty points,
                  when they rebook their appointments.

                  Offer incentives to your service providers and front desk
                  staff to build even more motivation for rebooking clients.

                  When a guest cannot rebook before leaving, always share how
                  easy it is to rebook online or using your mobile app -- often

              It goes without saying that spas and salons are nothing without
              their service providers. Businesses rely on their training and
              talent!
            </p>

            <p>
              Staff turnover doesn’t only hurt morale in your salon, it also
              impacts your business. The cost of losing a team member can add up
              to thousands of dollars. Even more frightening, 76% of guests
              confessed to feeling more loyal to their service provider than to
              the business, so the odds of retaining a guest if their service
              provider decides to leave are less than 25%.
