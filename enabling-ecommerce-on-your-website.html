                How many times have you shopped online in the last three
                months? If you’re like most Americans, it’s probably a lot.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2020 there were more than 255 million digital buyers.
                That’s 88% of the U.S. population (Statista). And if you’re
                thinking that year was an exception because of Covid-19 you
                would be mistaken as the number of online shoppers is expected
                to grow to over 278 million in 2024 (fitsmallbusiness.com)
              </p>

                Capitalize upon this and further enhance the guest experience
                by incorporating online shopping into your website.

                Offering your retail products online makes them accessible to
                millions of viewers. This means you no longer need to rely on
                street traffic, or service provider recommendations to move the
                products off your shelves. If you make your own products, it can
                even help to grow brand awareness.

                Ultimately, online shopping is becoming part of the salon and

                In today's world guests are more cognizant of their choices
                and aware of what they are using for their beauty and haircare
                routines. You may have heard a guest say, “I want to look that
                up” and you know that the likelihood that they will leave and
                return for the product is slim. By integrating Ecommerce to
                supplement sales in your salon and spa, you can recapture
                guests that may have not been ready to make a purchase
                decision at the time of checkout. You can also entice them to
                shop with you in the future by integrating their loyalty
                points in with their product purchases.

                It is not only about product sales. You can also capture a
                piece of the digital gifting industry by making gift cards
                available for purchase online. Gift givers will appreciate the
                convenience of purchasing their gifts in the comfort of their
                own home - especially last-minute shoppers!

                We already know that in this industry guests are coming in for
                their visits less than five times a year. So, what happens if
                they need replenishment before their visit? Combat the
                temptation of shopping from a big box store by creating a
                digital shopping experience. This way you’re not only
                marketing to your guests when they browse your website, but
                you’re creating an effortless experience by allowing them to
                purchase with the click of a button.
