                        “I think I want to make less money,” said no one ever. We love what we do. It’s creative,
                        innovative, and most importantly, it makes people look and feel good. And we’re all about
                        feeling good and finding great, but this is also a business. And a lucrative business, with over
                        $57 billion in salon and spa sales generated in 2019 (Professional Beauty Association report).

                        There is clearly money to be made in this industry, and the tools to do so are already at your
                        disposal. Even if you hate the constant coaching on rebooking and selling retail, those
                        strategies are not going away, and they are proving to be more necessary than ever before.
                        That’s why you need a defined plan to increase your revenue by improving your average spend.

                        Before you dive into the list above, you should review some key considerations about your guest
                        base. You don’t want to focus heavily on average spend if your guest base is stagnant,
                        shrinking, or
                        lacking in loyalty.

                        <b>Guest Acquisition:</b> One of the most expensive undertakings a business will incur is guest
                        acquisition. In fact, it can cost 5X more to attract a new guest, than it does to retain an
                        existing
                        one. This means after working to acquire new guests, you’ll definitely want to work even harder
                        to
                        retain them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        <b>Guest Retention: </b> Increasing retention rates by just 5% can improve profits by 25% to 95%
                        (Forbes). With the average retention percentage at just 30% (Summit Salon Business Center),
                        there’s
                        plenty of opportunity to increase retention. Do not let 7 out of every 10 guests slip through
                        your
                        doors without a return visit.

                        <b>Guest Loyalty:</b> Loyal guests spend more money. Zenoti customer data shows the top 20% of

                        account for a whopping 95% of all revenues! Your loyal guests are willing to spend more, so help

                        So guests are visiting quarterly, even though most service providers recommend they return every

                        to save money and/or time. Unfortunately, their hair—and your bank account—are paying the price.

                        expense associated to acquire new guests. More visits will also mean more opportunities to
                        promote service enhancements and retail sales, which adds to your profit.

                        Getting guests to rebook before they leave your shop lets your service providers control the
                        appointment cadence, and the guest is less likely to stretch them out over longer periods of
                        time. Rebooking is one of the most powerful ways to increase FOV. Guests are less tempted to go
                        elsewhere when they are all set with their next appointment before they head out for the rest of
                        their day.

                            loyalty. You want your business to be synonymous with their beauty and wellness needs.
                            Implementing tiered loyalty programs, where the more they spend, the richer the rewards,
                            will show these guests how much you value them. Plus, data shows loyal guests spend more
                            each year. For instance, 41% of consumers are more likely to do their holiday shopping with
                            brands they love (Yotpo).

                        In 2015, Delta Airlines made headlines when they retooled their frequent-flier program to favor
                        passengers who buy the priciest tickets instead of those who fly the most miles. It was intended
                        to lure higher-spending business travelers, who often book flights on short notice and pay more
                        than bargain-hunting leisure travelers. And it worked. Delta Airlines saw an increase of 13.4%
                        in the following four years and is now ranked #2 for airlines in the U.S. (Yahoo News).

                        When you consider your average spend per visit, think about it as capitalizing on the “ticket
                        price” for each guest scheduled to walk through your doors. For example, each time block on your
                        appointment book is an item to sell, and if a service provider is booked for the day, daily
                        revenues can only grow by increasing the ticket price of each guest. The strategies below will
                        help you increase each day’s average spend per visit.

                            (ModernSalon.com). This is not a happy accident. Leaders in the industry have figured out

                            retail sales are a profitable addition to their core service offerings.

                        It goes beyond the dollars. Retail sales have a direct correlation with retention. Based on a

                        If your guest purchases three products from you, they are most likely yours for life. The
                        science behind this comes down to trust and brand loyalty.

                                card sales provide proven revenue. Plus, gift card recipients have the potential to
                                generate higher revenue in a single visit, as Zenoti reports that 65% of guests spent
                                40% more than the value of the card they received.

                                Gift cards can also drive sales during unforeseen circumstances. During the COVID

                                They were able to recover $35,000 in direct revenue, despite the salon location not
                                being open for business. For all the benefits of selling gift cards please refer to the
