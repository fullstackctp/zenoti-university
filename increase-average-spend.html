                        “I think I want to make less money,” said no one ever. We love what we do. It’s creative,
                        innovative, and most importantly, it makes people look and feel good. And we’re all about
                        feeling good and finding great, but this is also a business. And a lucrative business, with over
                        $57 billion in salon and spa sales generated in 2019 (Professional Beauty Association report).

                        strategies are not going away, and they are proving to be more necessary than ever before.
                        That’s why you need a defined plan to increase your revenue by improving your average spend.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Think about the guests you saw four months ago. Have you seen them walk back through your
                        doors?
                        Think back to the end of their appointment, you’ve swept up their hair, escorted them to the
                        coat room, and chatted as you approached the desk. In those last few minutes with that
                        guest,
                        did you remember to invite them back in? If you forgot, it may have cost you.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        As salon professionals you understand the importance of rebooking. What you may not know is that
                        the industry average for Frequency of Visit (FOV) is 4.88 times per year (BehindtheChair.com).
                        So guests are visiting quarterly, even though most service providers recommend they return every
                        6-8 weeks to keep their desired look. Ultimately, guests are stretching out their appointments
                        to save money and/or time. Unfortunately, their hair—and your bank account—are paying the price.

                        Plus, if you can boost FOV to 8 visits per year, you will double your revenue without the
                        expense associated to acquire new guests. More visits will also mean more opportunities to
                        promote service enhancements and retail sales, which adds to your profit.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Getting guests to rebook before they leave your shop lets your service providers control the
                        appointment cadence, and the guest is less likely to stretch them out over longer periods of
                        time. Rebooking is one of the most powerful ways to increase FOV. Guests are less tempted to go
                        elsewhere when they are all set with their next appointment before they head out for the rest of
                        their day.

                            each year. For instance, 41% of consumers are more likely to do their holiday shopping with
                            brands they love (Yotpo).

                        passengers who buy the priciest tickets instead of those who fly the most miles. It was intended
                        to lure higher-spending business travelers, who often book flights on short notice and pay more
                        than bargain-hunting leisure travelers. And it worked. Delta Airlines saw an increase of 13.4%
                        in the following four years and is now ranked #2 for airlines in the U.S. (Yahoo News).

                        guests
                        really want? High-end services, of course!

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        What’s the least expensive service you offer? Perhaps a lip wax, nail polish change, or a
                        color toner? Can you make a living performing only these services? On your busiest days,
                        would you be excited to do 8 hours' worth of lip waxes? If you answered “no”, it’s because
                        you know you can’t survive on low-price services alone. High-end services are the key to
                        good wages.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Offering and promoting high-end services is so impactful it can increase both average spend per
                        guest and average spend per visit. Specialty services not only offer amazing results, they also
                        pack a revenue punch. Booking a high-end service means you’re selling blocks of time for a
                        higher profit. So it follows, a day booked with high-end services is a day with high-earnings.

                Often guests book services with little direction and may book a standard service as a placeholder.
                You should never assume a guest knows what is best for them and your service providers should feel
                empowered to suggest high-end services that are going to provide amazing results. For instance, the
                average facial costs $65-$90, and a HydraFacial averages $199-$300 per service. By recommending a
                HydraFacial, you just sold your time for 3X more revenue than the classic service.

                        When you consider your average spend per visit, think about it as capitalizing on the “ticket
                        price” for each guest scheduled to walk through your doors. For example, each time block on your
                        appointment book is an item to sell, and if a service provider is booked for the day, daily
                        revenues can only grow by increasing the ticket price of each guest. The strategies below will

                        Before you dive into the list above, take some time to know your numbers. When looking over
                        invoices from the prior day, does anything stand out? Hopefully, you see cross-selling,
                        upselling, and other ways the spend was increased for your guest visits. Maybe you recommended a
                        deep conditioning treatment or took the time to shop the retail wall with the guest before
                        saying goodbye. If there is little of that to be found, you are in the right place to develop
                        the right strategies.

                        conversation from, “What’s new with you?” to “What’s new to buy in the salon? I’d love to take a

                            The average U.S. hair salon services revenue makes up 92% of provider income. The other 8%

                            retail sales. However, the most successful salons boast a retail percentage of 14 - 18%
                            (ModernSalon.com). This is not a happy accident. Leaders in the industry have figured out
                            that
                            retail sales are a profitable addition to their core service offerings.

                        It goes beyond the dollars. Retail sales have a direct correlation with retention. Based on a
                        study conducted by Sam Villa, for each product sold there’s a 30% chance the guest will return.
                        If your guest purchases three products from you, they are most likely yours for life. The
                        science behind this comes down to trust and brand loyalty.

                            Everyone loves a great deal. When you shop and you find a great deal you feel good. You are
                            less guilty about spending the money, and you are more likely to share your shopping
                            experience with friends and family so that they too can benefit.

                        The salon and spa industry can capitalize on bundles in both a service capacity, as well as a
                        retail capacity. This strategy boosts total revenue by increasing the amount spent on each
                        transaction. Done well, product bundling is a win-win that increases your revenue and keeps your
                        inventory moving.

                            Bundled services reward returning guests and encourage new guests to stick with their
                            appointments. This is particularly helpful in the case of corrective services, where it can
                            take a few appointments for guests to start seeing the results. Or for services that require
                            regular maintenance, like manicures.
