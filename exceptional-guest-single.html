            <p>
              Now, more than ever, time is the most precious form of currency.
              It seems the moment one thing comes off our to-do lists, three
              things are added. Luckily, today’s technology compresses the time
              it takes to do most things. What once took hours can now take
              minutes, and what used to take minutes can now be done in mere
              seconds!
            </p>
            <p>
              Because of their demanding lives, guests want convenience and
              ease. They expect hassle-free interactions and a quick, seamless
              flow. Simple tasks like booking an appointment, checking the date
              of their last service, or confirming the balance on a gift card,
              are all things guests want to do on a “self-serve” basis. With
              digital advancements, your business can – and must – deliver those
              self-service tools.
            </p>
            <p>
              There’s an obvious upside for guests when they can take matters
              into their own hands, but this also presents you and your staff
              with many advantages. Rather than focus on their “transactional”
              needs, you can put your efforts into delivering all the
              touchpoints that make up an exceptional guest experience.
            </p>

              In this lesson, we will consider the customer lifecycle, from
              their first impression to the final reflection of their visit.
              Highlighting along the way how well-integrated technology can
              further enhance their experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              To show how seamless the guest experience can be with intuitive
              and well-integrated technology, we’re going follow the lifecycle
              of a prospective guest, Lily.

                          Lily is winding down from the day. Her kids are in

                          area and needs to find a good salon.

            option to book an appointment was to call the business. Since it was

            Lily clicks the third listing and it’s instantly more promising than
            the last. There is a link to download a Service Menu PDF, so Lily
            can review their offerings and starting prices. “This could be a
            winner,” she thinks to herself as she clicks around to look for
            images of their work. Unfortunately, there are no pictures and no
            links to Instagram or Facebook. Leary of how talented the service
            providers may be, she moves on to the fourth search result.

              place.”</i

            The page was bright and crisp, the photos were high-quality, and
            there was a “Book Now” button at the top of the page. Lily was also
            impressed to see that the salon had their own mobile app. This is
            just what Lily was looking for, so she clicks on “Book Now” and
            begins the booking process. “This is a good experience; I’m excited
            I found this place!” she thinks to herself.

            <p>
              Lily’s journey shows not only how important it is to offer online
              booking to your guests, but also that it’s a vital touchpoint of
              your guest’s journey. Lily has never stepped into the salon, she
              wasn’t referred by a friend, and she does not have a new guest
              promotion, but the salon’s online presence and ability to book
              online, along with connecting with the staff via text, has made a
              personal impact on Lily.

                online over other channels.

                        follows with a shampoo and incredible long-layered
                        haircut. Lily feels as great as she looks.

                        Chloe recaps the appointment and recommends the
                        smoothing serum she used. Lily is hesitant to purchase
                        because she has a cabinet full of products. To her
                        delight, Chloe understands and adds the recommendation
                        to Lily’s notes, in case she’s interested next time.

            <h3>Visit Review:</h3>
            <p>
              For Lily, the in-salon experience was greatly enhanced with the
              use of Zenoti Go. Her connections with the stylist and esthetician
              were focused on the services they provided, not on check-in tasks,
              filling forms, or waiting to pay.
            </p>
            <ul class="mb-0" style="padding-left: 2rem !important">
              <li>
                No more waiting at the front desk to check-in. Zenoti Go uses
                geofencing to recognize a customer’s arrival and sends them an
                auto-prompt to check-in on their mobile device. Once check-in is
                confirmed, the service provider receives a notification on their
                personal device.
              </li>
              <li>
                After the service, your customers breeze through the exit,
                skipping the check-out line. Your provider uses their mobile
                device to add any retail purchases or add-ons to the invoice and
                initiates an automatic payment.
              </li>
              <li>
                Customers receive an Auto-Pay confirmation on their app and can
                add additional tips on the go. Customers can also add tips and
                directly pay on the app. With alerts on payment failures, salon
                staff can be assured that every departing customer has paid.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your providers and front desk benefit from the reduced use of
                shared devices and fewer customer interactions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Service providers are empowered to update appointments, upsell
                at the chair or in the treatment room, add retail or add-ons to
                invoices, and initiate payment — helping them focus on
                meaningful customer interactions.

              Four weeks after her visit to the salon, Lily notices her brows
              need waxing again. Lily really liked her esthetician but can’t
              recall her name. Lily remembers she has the salon app and is
              pretty sure she’ll find the name there. She launches the app and
              takes a look.

              In the app, Lily clicks “Appointments” on the menu. A list of
              future and past appointments is shown. She toggles to “Past
              Appointments” and notices not only are the provider names listed,
              but there’s also a “Rebook Appointment” button.

              Lily happily refers her friends and family to the salon. Using the

              appointment. Once her referrals go to the salon and complete a
              service, Lily earns more points.

                  You have many opportunities to win a new guest, from the
                  second they find your business online or hear a rave review
                  from someone they trust. Every touchpoint a guest has with
                  your business can either strengthen or weaken their perception
                  of your brand. Your goal is to have your guest thinking:
                </p>
                <ul style="padding-left: 2rem !important">
                  <li>“It is so easy to get an appointment here.”</li>
                  <li>
                    “I’m able to do everything at my own pace when I use my
                    phone during my visit with their business”.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  When your guest experience allows you to connect with
                  customers whether they are at home, on the job, or in your
                  shop, they feel as though they belong to something. They are
                  part of your family, and they can keep in touch in the palm of
                  their hands the way that they would with their own friends and
                  family. You connect with them on an emotional level, and you
                  stay connected with them even when they are away.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Why focus on guest experience touchpoints? To power an
                  exceptional, touchless client experience. For the ease and
                  simplicity. And to keep salons always open, and always
                  connected. There is not enough time in the day, by investing
                  in ways to optimize your processes, and give back some of the
                  guest's time, your guest will continue to invest in you.
                  Afterall, time is the most precious form of currency.
