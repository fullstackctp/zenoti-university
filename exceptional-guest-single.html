            Now, more than ever, time is the most precious form of currency.
            It seems the moment one thing comes off our to-do lists, three
            things are added. Luckily, today’s technology compresses the time
            it takes to do most things. What once took hours can now take
            minutes, and what used to take minutes can now be done in mere
            seconds!

          <p class="text-justify">
            Because of their demanding lives, guests want convenience and
            ease. They expect hassle-free interactions and a quick, seamless
            flow. Simple tasks like booking an appointment, checking the date
            of their last service, or confirming the balance on a gift card,
            are all things guests want to do on a “self-serve” basis. With
            digital advancements, your business can – and must – deliver those
            self-service tools.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            There’s an obvious upside for guests when they can take matters
            into their own hands, but this also presents you and your staff
            with many advantages. Rather than focus on their “transactional”
            needs, you can put your efforts into delivering all the
            touchpoints that make up an exceptional guest experience.

            Lily just moved into a new home in a new town. She and her family are finally unpacked and settled in, and

            husband is looking for a new massage therapist, and Lily wants to find a really great salon. Let’s follow
            Lily on the journey from her living room sofa to the salon of her dreams.

          Lily clicks the third listing and it’s instantly more promising than
          the last. There is a link to download a Service Menu PDF, so Lily
          can review their offerings and starting prices. “This could be a
          winner,” she thinks to herself as she clicks around to look for
          images of their work. Unfortunately, there are no pictures and no
          links to Instagram or Facebook. Leary of how talented the service
          providers may be, she moves on to the fourth search result.

          Finally, Lily’s first impression is positive, and she thinks,

            place.”</i>
          The page was bright and crisp, the photos were high-quality, and
          there was a “Book Now” button at the top of the page. Lily was also
          impressed to see that the salon had their own mobile app. This is
          just what Lily was looking for, so she clicks on “Book Now” and
          begins the booking process. “This is a good experience; I’m excited
          I found this place!” she thinks to herself.

          <h3>Book Review:</h3>
          <p>
            Lily’s journey shows not only how important it is to offer online
            booking to your guests, but also that it’s a vital touchpoint of
            your guest’s journey. Lily has never stepped into the salon, she
            wasn’t referred by a friend, and she does not have a new guest
            promotion, but the salon’s online presence and ability to book
            online, along with connecting with the staff via text, has made a
            personal impact on Lily.
          </p>
          <ul class="mb-0" style="padding-left: 2rem !important">
            <li>
              It is quickly becoming a preferred method for booking. Data
              shows that over 70% of a salon’s customers prefer to self-book
              online over other channels.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your appointment book becomes available to guests 24/7. On
              average, Zenoti customers see 46% of self-service bookings
              taking place outside business hours (9pm-8am) via website or
              mobile app.
            </li>
            <li>
              29% of new guests are booking their appointment online. These
              new guests can book quickly or take their time to browse and
              explore everything that you have to offer.

                      follows with a shampoo and incredible long-layered
                      haircut. Lily feels as great as she looks.

                    <p>
                      Chloe recaps the appointment and recommends the
                      smoothing serum she used. Lily is hesitant to purchase
                      because she has a cabinet full of products. To her
                      delight, Chloe understands and adds the recommendation

          <h3>Visit Review:</h3>
          <p>
            For Lily, the in-salon experience was greatly enhanced with the
            use of Zenoti Go. Her connections with the stylist and esthetician
            were focused on the services they provided, not on check-in tasks,
            filling forms, or waiting to pay.
          </p>
          <ul class="mb-0" style="padding-left: 2rem !important">
            <li>
              No more waiting at the front desk to check-in. Zenoti Go uses
              geofencing to recognize a customer’s arrival and sends them an
              auto-prompt to check-in on their mobile device. Once check-in is
              confirmed, the service provider receives a notification on their
              personal device.
            </li>
            <li>
              After the service, your customers breeze through the exit,
              skipping the check-out line. Your provider uses their mobile
              device to add any retail purchases or add-ons to the invoice and
              initiates an automatic payment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Customers receive an Auto-Pay confirmation on their app and can
              add additional tips on the go. Customers can also add tips and
              directly pay on the app. With alerts on payment failures, salon
              staff can be assured that every departing customer has paid.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your providers and front desk benefit from the reduced use of
              shared devices and fewer customer interactions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Service providers are empowered to update appointments, upsell
              at the chair or in the treatment room, add retail or add-ons to
              invoices, and initiate payment — helping them focus on
              meaningful customer interactions.

              Rating their experiences and sharing valuable feedback is super
              quick for guests with an intuitive, tag-based format. Tracking
              and follow up is easy using a guest satisfaction dashboard. You
              can coach your providers based on feedback, follow up on
              negative experiences, and win back unhappy clients. You can also
              build your brand’s online reputation by redirecting customers to
              share online reviews.
            </li>
            <li>
              Rebooking is easy with past and future appointment tracking
              available in online and mobile booking. In no time, guests can
              rebook their requested service with their favorite provider on
              their ideal date/time.

              Happy customers come back and refer new customers. Integrated
              technology lets them refer-a-friend digitally by sending emails,
              texts, or social media links to book with your business. Your
              guests will be notified when a friend or family members finishes
              a service and points are awarded. Guests will be further
              invested with your loyalty program and drive additional visits
              as they watch their points accumulate.

                color six weeks ago, but do not have a future appointment. A discount or promotion may be just what they
                need to book!

                You have many opportunities to win a new guest, from the
                second they find your business online or hear a rave review
                from someone they trust. Every touchpoint a guest has with
                your business can either strengthen or weaken their perception
                of your brand. Your goal is to have your guest thinking:
              </p>
              <ul style="padding-left: 2rem !important">
                <li>“It is so easy to get an appointment here.”</li>
                <li>
                  “I’m able to do everything at my own pace when I use my
                  phone during my visit with their business”.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                When your guest experience allows you to connect with
                customers whether they are at home, on the job, or in your
                shop, they feel as though they belong to something. They are
                part of your family, and they can keep in touch in the palm of
                their hands the way that they would with their own friends and
                family. You connect with them on an emotional level, and you
                stay connected with them even when they are away.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why focus on guest experience touchpoints? To power an
                exceptional, touchless client experience. For the ease and
                simplicity. And to keep salons always open, and always
                connected. There is not enough time in the day, by investing
                in ways to optimize your processes, and give back some of the
                guest's time, your guest will continue to invest in you.
                Afterall, time is the most precious form of currency.
