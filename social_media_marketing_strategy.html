                When was the last time you opened your phone to check Instagram

              </p>
              <p>
                Was it right before starting this course? Or did a notification

                If it was recently, you’re not alone. Nearly half of users open
                Instagram more than once a day.   And research shows people
                spend 145 minutes a day on social media platforms. That’s two
                and a half hours every day!

            <div class="mt-3">
              <p>
                Social media marketing is sharing content to promote your
                business and products on various social media
                platforms. It’s about meeting your guests where they’re at and
                engaging with them there.   Here’s a quick summary of the top
                social media platforms we covered in the Social Media Presence:
                Why It's Essential for Your Business course.

              <p>
                Wellness-related content is popular across visual platforms
                including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest. Therefore, we
                recommend focusing on these channels.  
              </p>
              <p>
                There are five core pillars of social media marketing that we’ll
                be covering later in the course but first it’s important to
                understand why having a social media strategy is essential for
                your salon or spa.

              Why is it Important in the Beauty and Wellness Industry? 
            </h2>
            <div class="mt-3">
              <p>
                Social media marketing is key in the beauty and wellness
                industry simply because of the sheer number of people
                who actively use it every day. There’s no other way to reach and
                engage with that many people in real-time.  
              </p>
              <p>
                More than 80% of the 1 billion active users on Instagram use
                it to research products and services.  For salons, spas,
                and medspas, this presents incredible opportunities to elevate
                your online presence, increase engagement, and drive sales.

            <div class="mt-3">
              <p>
                As we alluded to earlier in the course, social media marketing
                has five core pillars.  
              </p>
              <div class="d-flex mb-3 justify-content-center">
                <img
                  src="./img/placeholder.png"
                  alt=""
                  class="img-responsive img-fluid"
                />
              </div>
              <h3>1. Strategy  </h3>
              <p>
                The first step in any marketing plan is to know who you
                are, who you’re talking to, where you’ll reach them, and how.  
              </p>
              <p><b>Define Your Brand Personality</b></p>
              <p>
                Establish your page aesthetics and tone of voice to create a
                consistent look and feel that people will come to recognize as
                your brand.  
              </p>
              <div class="mx-5">
                <ul>
                  <li>What are your brand colors?</li>
                  <li>What are your brand fonts?</li>
                  <li>
                    What is your tone (funny, professional, trendy, etc.)?
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <p>
                You may have established this when you launched your business.
                If so, consider if your current aesthetic is still relevant? Is
                it reaching your ideal guests? Does it need a re-vamp?   If you
                haven’t established this, now is the time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Take Boss Gal Beauty, for example. What does their page say to
                you?
              </p>
              <p>
                They use a consistent, overall color palette so the feed looks
                cohesive. Think about it, if someone is looking to book a
                service with you that they hope will make them look and feel
                good - do your social media platforms convey that message to
                them?

              <p>
                Define the roles and responsibilities for your team and ensure
                they have all the information they need. Consider: 
              </p>
              <div class="mx-5">
                <ul>
                  <li>Who handles overseeing the strategy?</li>

                  </li>
                  <li>Who will be engaging with your audience? </li>
                  <li>What is your posting and engagement cadence? </li>
                  <li>
                    Do the right people have access to the right information
                    (passwords, etc.)? 
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h3>Create a Content Calendar</h3>
              <p>
                This doesn’t have to be overly complex. It can be a simple
                Google sheet with the following: 
              </p>
              <div class="mx-5">
                <ul>
                  <li>Platforms - Facebook, Instagram, etc.</li>
                  <li>
                    Publish Dates - A weekly or monthly look at content to be
                    published, based on your cadence answered above.
                  </li>
                  <li>Content Type – Video, Reel, feed post, ad, etc.</li>
                  <li>
                    Content Mix – How much of your content will be paid vs.
                    organic, sales vs. education, etc.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p>Pro Tip: </p>
              <p>
                If you’re starting out, Hootsuite recommends the 80-20 rule: 
              </p>
              <p>
                80% of your posts should inform, educate, or entertain your
                audience (this can include influencer marketing).
              </p>
              <p>
                20% can directly promote your brand (this can include giveaways,
                promotions, and paid marketing).
              </p>
              <h3>Establish Goals</h3>
              <p>
                What are your social media goals and what are the metrics (also
                known as KPIs or key performance indicators) you will use to
                track your performance?  
              </p>
              <p>
                If you’re feeling overwhelmed by that question, know it doesn't
                have to be some elaborate concept. It can be as simple as
                reaching a wider audience to grow brand awareness or generating
                more referral traffic to your website through social media. If
                you set metric to it, you make it a powerful goal.  
              </p>
              <p>For example: </p>
              <p>
                If your goal is to increase your Instagram followers by 5% month
                over month, then you would document the number of followers
                you’re starting with and review that number, as well as the
                tactics you used, monthly to establish if your current plan is
                working to meet your goals or if you need to adjust.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Sometimes a simple strategy is the best choice. Once you have an
                established plan and are seeing results, you can build it out
                further and include specific goals, metrics, and calendars for
                both paid and organic content (more on that later!). 
              </p>
              <h3>2. Create and Publish Content</h3>
              <p>
                Once you’ve established your foundation, it’s time to start
                creating. Use these tips as general guidelines and see module
                5 <a class="text-0d6efd">module</a> for specific ideas.  
              </p>
              <p>Provide Useful and Digestible Content  </p>
              <p>
                Become a thought leader in the industry and increase bookings
                by providing content your audience wants.  
              </p>
              <p>How do you know what they want? Ask and listen. </p>
              <p>
                Read your reviews, listen to what your front desk staff is
                talking to guests about, send out a survey, and keep your finger
                on the pulse of industry trends
              </p>
              <h3>3. Listen and Engage </h3>
              <p>
                Building a brand on social media requires you to be active and
                post relevant content. Community is a two-way street that
                includes both proactive and reactive engagement.  
              </p>
              <h3>Proactive Engagement</h3>
              <p>
                Use features like stories, videos, lives, reels, etc. to create
                simple and cost-effective video content so your audience can
                engage with a real person. This is ideal for new launches,
                promotions, how-to’s, and free value-add services like
                education.  
              </p>
              <h3>Reactive Engagement  </h3>
              <p>
                Use comments, shares, and industry hashtags to authentically
                connect with your ideal guest and stay connected with your
                audience. 
              </p>

              <h3>Advertise </h3>
              <p>
                For maximum reach, consider both organic and paid content. While
                they do intersect, the best way to think of them is that paid is
                a way to build your audience and organic is a tool to nurture
                existing followers.  
              </p>
              <h3>Organic Content </h3>
              <p>
                Is all the free content you post (feed
                posts, stories, reels, etc.). It’s seen by a percentage of your
                followers, and anyone searching the hashtags or locations you
                include. Organic content is one of the best ways to convey your
                brand personality, educate about your products and
                services, stay engaged with your followers, and even drive
                sales.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Visual social media platforms like Instagram are being used as
                virtual stores and using the feed as a product display.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Take the widely popular cosmetics brand, Glossier for example.
                They make it convenient to shop for their products, directly
                from their feed. Users simply click on a picture to shop.

              <div class="d-flex mb-3 justify-content-center">
                <img
                  src="./img/placeholder.png"
                  alt=""

              <h3>Paid Content </h3>
              <p>
                Paid ads and boosting posts are both forms
                of paid advertising. These are posts that you pay to boost or
                ads that you create, both are target specific audiences.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Paid advertising includes boosting a post where you pay to have
                your post seen by a specific audience, awareness ads where you
                target a new audience to generate leads, competitor
                advertising where you target people who actively engage with
                other brands in your industry and remarketing or retargeting
                ads where you serve up an ad to someone who has previously been
                to your website or has engaged with your previous Facebook
                ads or Facebook page. 
              </p>
              <p>
                One simple way to get started with paid content is creating
                a Facebook ad.  
              </p>
              <p>
                These ads are highly customizable and budget friendly. You’re
                able to leverage Facebook’s data to set your audience and target
                your ideal demographic. You can also choose the ad’s
                placement from in-feed, to stories, to appearing on the
                right-hand side of the page, and more.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Facebook ads are a great way to test out your
                audience and different types of content. You can try different
                demographics or ad placements and see which performs best.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Ads can be as simple as an in-feed static image post. However,
                you may want to consider more dynamic options like <a
                  class="text-0d6efd"
                  >Sephora’s video ad</a
                > below or carousel images. Both have recently seen high
                engagement rates, so Facebook recommends this approach to catch
                your audience's attention.  
              </p>
              <div class="d-flex mb-3 justify-content-center">
                <img

                It is important to note that paid advertising doesn’t
                include paid influencer content. Yes, that will be a paid
                expense, but it is a separate strategy that we’ll explore in
                module 5. <a class="text-0d6efd">Click Here</a>

              <p>
                Social media strategy is nothing without goals, metrics, and a
                review process. This isn’t the boring part, and it doesn’t have
                to be tedious admin work.  
              </p>
              <p>
                You don’t have to track everything. Track what’s important to
                you, based on your business goals and social media strategy.  
              </p>
              <p>
                The metrics you watch may evolve over time as your
                business grows and your goals change. However, as a general
                guideline, here are our top recommendations for key metrics to
                track:  
              </p>
              <p>If your goal is Awareness and Growth track... </p>
              <p>
                Audience Growth - Document the number of
                followers you’re starting with, then look at your new followers
                after a pre-determined amount of time (i.e., monthly, directly
                following a giveaway, or paid influencer post, etc.).  
              </p>
              <p>
                To find out your audience growth rate percentage, divide the
                number of new followers by your total following and multiply by
                100.  
              </p>
              <div class="d-flex mb-3 justify-content-center">
                <img
                  src="./img/placeholder.png"
                  alt=""
                  class="img-responsive img-fluid"
                />
              </div>
              <p>
                100 new followers ÷ 1000 total followers x 100 = 10 new
                followers 
              </p>
              <p>
                Reach and Impressions - Monitoring both reach and impressions
                will give you a good idea of how much awareness your social
                media efforts are bringing to your business. While similar
                metrics, reach is the number of people who saw your content, and
                impressions are the number of times your content was
                displayed.  
              </p>
              <div class="d-flex mb-3 justify-content-center">

              </div>
              <p>
                Pro Tip: Use built–in analytics on platforms like Instagram to
                see your top-performing organic content including posts,
                stories, reels, lives, etc. You can find this data by clicking
                “insights” on your profile. 
              </p>
              <p>If your goal is Sales Conversion track... </p>
              <p>
                Click-Through Rate and Referral Traffic - Use built-in analytics
                on platforms like Instagram and Facebook to see how well your
                ads (also known as “promotions” on Instagram) converted to
                purchase or booking from your website. You can also use your
                website analytics to monitor referral traffic
                sources. Like click-through rate, this information tells you
                which content and source is driving traffic to your website.  
              </p>
              <p>If your goal is Loyalty and Advocacy track... </p>
              <p>
                Engagement - Understand your engagement on both organic and
                boosted posts to learn how your content is performing so you can
                do more of what’s working, and less of what isn’t. Engagement
                metrics include likes, comments, and saves. Use all three
                metrics for a holistic understanding of engagement. 
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, if a post has 10 likes, 100 comments, and 1000
                saves, that is engaging content. If you only measured
                likes, you'll have missed how engaging that post was. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Consider analytics as the key to unlocking your guest’s
                innermost needs and wants so you can maximize your efforts and
                serve up exactly what they’re looking for.  
              </p>
              <p>Stay Open to Change</p>
              <p>
                If your Facebook Ads aren’t driving website conversion or
                bookings, they aren’t working. If your guests aren’t engaged
                with the content you post on Instagram, it’s not working.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Each platform has its base level of analytics you can review,
                but if you want to go deeper to dig into this priceless data,
                consider an all-in-one software solution, like Zenoti, that
                serves up more detailed insights into your published content.

                multiple channels or spending hours building manual reports.

                Now that we have all the foundations, it’s time to have some
                fun! Let’s look at a variety of social
                media tactics for your plan #Inspo.  
              </p>
              <h3>Giveaways </h3>
              <p>
                Who doesn’t love a giveaway? Gift free products and services or
                connect with aligned brands for a co-marketing giveaway effort
                to reach an even wider audience. Consider this topical content
                that can be used to highlight new products or services, create
                brand awareness, and encourage engagement. Incorporate “tag a
                friend” and contesting to take your giveaways to the next
                level. Keep in mind, you want to include a clear CTA (call to
                action), so your audience knows what to do. 
              </p>

                Using <a class="text-0d6efd">The NOW massage boutique</a> as an
                example, their Summer Giveaway, where they partnered with other
                beauty and wellness brands, generated over 200 comments compared
                to surrounding posts which generated 3- 50 comments. 
              </p>
              <div class="d-flex mb-3 justify-content-center">
                <img

                  class="img-responsive img-fluid"
                />
              </div>
              <h3>Gamify Your Feed </h3>
              <p>
                Given the popularity of games, challenges, and memes, you can
                use trending topics to gamify your feed. Couple this with the
                fact that video and animation content perform well, use
                this strategy to engage your community and show off your
                personality. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Can you challenge your audience to share their worst childhood
                hair photo and build out a contest around it? Or ask them to
                share a before and after video for a chance to be featured? How
                can you have fun with your audience with topical
                conversations?  
              </p>

                Let’s breakdown the elements of Zenoti customer,
                <a class="text-0d6efd">Depasquale The Spa’s</a> Instagram
                post to see this concept in action.  
              </p>
              <div class="d-flex mb-3 justify-content-center">

              </div>
              <p>
                Gamification - The caption includes a clear CTA to tag
                @depasqualethespa for a chance to be featured. This gamifies the
                post and encourages your guests to share UGC (user generate
                content).   UCG - This is a re-post from their
                client’s TikTok account. Using UGC builds a strong community.
                More on that later.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Provider Highlight - The post also includes a link to the
                provider’s account, highlighting their work and amplifying their
                profile.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Brand Personality - Depasquale The Spa highlights their brand
                personality using language like “gorgeous” and emoji use. 🤍  
              </p>
              <p>
                As you can see, you can achieve a lot in one post. And
                it doesn’t have to be hard!  
              </p>
              <h3>UGC</h3>
              <p>
                UGC (user-generated content) is an effortless way to gather
                organic content, solidify the bond with your guests (and
                providers!), and create referral traffic.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Imagine you posed a photo, tagging your favorite brand, and they
                reshared it on their account. How would you feel? Words
                like seen, appreciated, welcomed, and #Famous come to mind.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Use challenges, games, or a branded hashtag (as we discussed in
                the QuickStart Guide: Setting Up Key Social Media Platforms <a
                  class="text-0d6efd"
                  >ZU course</a
                >) as a CTA for your audience to share content that you can
                repurpose on your feed.  
              </p>
              <p>

                cancellations.  
              </p>
              <p>
                This strategy highlights providers, builds out UGC, fills their
                schedule, and uses topical content relevant to their guests.   s
              </p>
              <p>
                “Every salon experiences a slow week or unexpected
                cancellations. We have a few ways that we try to fill up open
                spots on our stylists' schedules. We encourage our stylists to
                use social media channels to let their friends and followers
                know they have a service schedule opening available. Then we
                support them using our salon’s Facebook, Twitter, and
                Instagram.”  
              </p>
              <h3>AMA</h3>
              <p>
                Host an AMA (ask me anything). This is a great way to engage
                your audience and gather valuable insights for future content.
                Create an evergreen campaign by hosting a weekly, monthly, or
                quarterly AMA and invite providers to take part. This increases
                your reach, adds a level of dynamics to the feature, and allows
                you to build out a longer-lasting campaign around this
                framework.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Bonus Tip: Create both video and
                written content of your AMA series and share it across multiple
                channels.  
              </p>
              <p>Social Media Takeovers and BTS (behind the scenes)</p>
              <p>
                You can use in-house providers or yourself (as the business
                owner) as the subject of your takeover. This showcases the
                people behind the brand, connecting you to your audience on a
                deeper level. Use video and images to show BTS footage of your
                salon or spa to give potential new guests a look into your
                business. Build out an evergreen campaign of weekly or monthly
                takeovers to get your audience excited about your brand
                and upcoming content.  
              </p>
              <p>
                BTS content doesn’t have to be limited to tours of your salon.
                <a class="text-0d6efd">Lunatic Fringe</a
                >, a Zenoti customer, uses BTS content in a variety of
                ways, from color mixing images to process photos and
                capturing that “after” photo feeling.

              <h3>Paid Influencers</h3>
              <p>
                Typically, when building an influencer partnership, you will
                start with paid posts. But keep the long game in mind and
                consider paid influencer partnerships that include a social
                media takeover as a powerful strategy to build your audience.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Consider <a class="text-0d6efd">Vital Proteins;</a> they
                built their brand on influencers and now have a thriving
                influencer community. 
              </p>

              </div>
              <p>
                Pro Tip: When looking for influencers, consider authenticity
                with your brand and engagement on their platforms. Just because
                someone has 100K followers doesn't mean they’re the right fit.  
              </p>
              <h3>Brand Collaborations </h3>
              <p>
                Different than a co-marketed giveaway or influencer partnership,
                brand collaborations are when you team up with one more business
                for an exclusive offer, promoted mutually across your
                platforms.   Key for reaching new potential guests, growing your
                social following, and creating buzz.   Get Creative -Build a
                summer-exclusive “ultimate spa package” in collaboration with a
                local restaurant, or winery.  Create an exclusive hair
                accessories line with a popular brand, like how skincare brand
                <a class="text-0d6efd">COOLA</a>, partnered with Sugar Fina for
                their “Stay Tropical” gift set.

                We’ll look at core pillars and fun content ideas in this course
                but it’s important to remember that you want to include social
                media in your overall marketing strategy <a class="text-0d6efd"

              <p>
                Strategy - Know who you are, whom you’re talking to, where and
                how you’re connecting with them. Know who on your team will be
                posting and who will be engaging with your community. Create a
                content calendar and block off time for posting and
                engagement. Establish your metrics, and then...  
              </p>
              <p>
                Create and Publish - Stay committed. Do what feels authentic to
                you and your brand.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Listen and Engage - Stay consistent. It takes time and effort to
                build an engaged audience, but it’s worth it.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Advertise - Promote your business. Use organic, paid, and
                influencer content to promote your business.   
              </p>
              <p>
                Analyze - Use analytics to understand your content’s
                performance. Establish a cadence for review of your metrics and
                be open to pivoting if needed.
