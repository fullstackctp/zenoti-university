              <p class="text-justify">
                Social media marketing is sharing content to promote your
                business and products on various social media
                platforms. It’s about meeting your guests where they’re at and
                engaging with them there.   Here’s a quick summary of the top
                social media platforms we covered in the Social Media Presence:

                Social media marketing is key in the beauty and wellness

              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                80% of your posts should inform, educate, or entertain your
                audience (this can include influencer marketing).
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                20% can directly promote your brand (this can include giveaways,
                promotions, and paid marketing).
              </p>
              <h3><b>Establish Goals</b></h3>
              <p class="text-justify">
                What are your social media goals and what are the metrics (also
                known as KPIs or key performance indicators) you will use to
                track your performance?  
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                If you’re feeling overwhelmed by that question, know it doesn't
                have to be some elaborate concept. It can be as simple as
                reaching a wider audience to grow brand awareness or generating
                more referral traffic to your website through social media. If
                you set metric to it, you make it a powerful goal.  
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">For example: </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                If your goal is to increase your Instagram followers by 5% month
                over month, then you would document the number of followers
                you’re starting with and review that number, as well as the
                tactics you used, monthly to establish if your current plan is
                working to meet your goals or if you need to adjust.  
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Sometimes a simple strategy is the best choice. Once you have an
                established plan and are seeing results, you can build it out
                further and include specific goals, metrics, and calendars for
                both paid and organic content (more on that later!). 
              </p>
              <h3>2. Create and Publish Content</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">

              <p class="text-justify">
                Building a brand on social media requires you to be active and
                post relevant content. Community is a two-way street that
                includes both proactive and reactive engagement.  
              </p>
              <h3>Proactive Engagement</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Use features like stories, videos, lives, reels, etc. to create
                simple and cost-effective video content so your audience can
                engage with a real person. This is ideal for new launches,
                promotions, how-to’s, and free value-add services like
                education.  
              </p>
              <h3>Reactive Engagement</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Use comments, shares, and industry hashtags to authentically
                connect with your ideal guest and stay connected with your
                audience.

              <p class="text-justify">
                For maximum reach,
                consider both <b>organic</b> and <b>paid</b> content. While they
                do intersect, the best way to think of them is that paid is
               a way to build your audience and organic is a tool to nurture
               existing followers.  
              </p>
              <h3><b>Organic Content </b></h3>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Is all the free content you post (feed
                posts, stories, reels, etc.). It’s seen by a percentage of your
                followers, and anyone searching the hashtags or locations you
                include. Organic content is one of the best ways to convey your
                brand personality, educate about your products and
                services, stay engaged with your followers, and even drive
                sales.  
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Visual social media platforms like Instagram are being used as
                virtual stores and using the feed as a product display.  
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Take the widely popular cosmetics brand, <b>Glossier</b> for
                example. They make it convenient to shop for their products,
                directly from their feed. Users simply click on a picture to
                shop.

              </div>
              <h3><b>Paid Content </b></h3>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Paid ads and boosting posts are both forms
                of paid advertising. These are posts that you pay to boost or
                ads that you create, both are target specific audiences.  
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Paid advertising includes <b>boosting a post</b> where you pay
                to have your post seen by a specific audience, <b
                  >awareness ads</b
                > where you target a new audience to generate leads, <b
                  >competitor advertising</b
                > where you target people who actively engage with other brands
                in your industry and <b>remarketing or retargeting ads</b> where
                you serve up an ad to someone who has previously been to your
                website or has engaged with your previous Facebook ads or
                Facebook page. 
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                One simple way to get started with paid content is creating a <b
                  >Facebook ad.</b
                >  
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                These ads are highly customizable and budget friendly. You’re
                able to leverage Facebook’s data to set your audience and target
                your ideal demographic. You can also choose the ad’s
                placement from in-feed, to stories, to appearing on the
                right-hand side of the page, and more.  
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Facebook ads are a great way to test out your
                audience and different types of content. You can try different
                demographics or ad placements and see which performs best.  
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Ads can be as simple as an in-feed static image post. However,
                you may want to consider more dynamic options like <a
                  href="https://www.facebook.com/business/success/2-sephora"
                  class="text_underline"
                  >Sephora’s video ad</a
                > below or carousel images. Both have recently seen high
                engagement rates, so Facebook recommends this approach to catch
                your audience's attention.  
              </p>
              <div class="d-flex mb-3 justify-content-center">

              <p class="text-justify">
                It is important to note that paid advertising doesn’t include <b
                  >paid influencer content.</b
                >
                Yes, that will be a paid expense, but it is a separate strategy
                that we’ll explore in module 5.
              </p>
              <h3>5. Analyze</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Social media strategy is nothing without goals, metrics, and a
                review process. This isn’t the boring part, and it doesn’t have
                to be tedious admin work.  
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                You don’t have to track everything. Track what’s important to
                you, based on your business goals and social media strategy.  
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                The metrics you watch may evolve over time as your
                business grows and your goals change. However, as a general
                guideline, here are our top recommendations for key metrics to
                track:  
              </p>

              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Audience Growth - Document the number of
                followers you’re starting with, then look at your new followers
                after a pre-determined amount of time (i.e., monthly, directly
                following a giveaway, or paid influencer post, etc.).  
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                To find out your audience growth rate percentage, divide the
                number of new followers by your total following and multiply by
                100.

              <p class="text-justify">
                Reach and Impressions - Monitoring both reach and impressions
                will give you a good idea of how much awareness your social
                media efforts are bringing to your business. While similar
                metrics, reach is the number of people who saw your content, and
                impressions are the number of times your content was
                displayed.  
              </p>

                <b>Pro Tip:</b> Use built–in analytics on platforms like
                Instagram to see your top-performing organic content including
                posts, stories, reels, lives, etc. You can find this data by
                clicking “insights” on your profile. 
              </p>

              <p class="text-justify">
                Click-Through Rate and Referral Traffic - Use built-in analytics
                on platforms like Instagram and Facebook to see how well your
                ads (also known as “promotions” on Instagram) converted to
                purchase or booking from your website. You can also use your
                website analytics to monitor referral traffic
                sources. Like click-through rate, this information tells you
                which content and source is driving traffic to your website.  
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">

              <p class="text-justify">
                Engagement - Understand your engagement on both organic and
                boosted posts to learn how your content is performing so you can
                do more of what’s working, and less of what isn’t. Engagement
                metrics include likes, comments, and saves. Use all three
                metrics for a holistic understanding of engagement. 
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                For example, if a post has 10 likes, 100 comments, and 1000
                saves, that is engaging content. If you only measured
                likes, you'll have missed how engaging that post was. 
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Consider analytics as the key to unlocking your guest’s
                innermost needs and wants so you can maximize your efforts and
                serve up exactly what they’re looking for.

              <p class="text-justify">
                If your Facebook Ads aren’t driving website conversion or
                bookings, they aren’t working. If your guests aren’t engaged
                with the content you post on Instagram, it’s not working.  
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Each platform has its base level of analytics you can review,

                that can be used to highlight new products or services, create
                brand awareness, and encourage engagement. Incorporate “tag a
                friend” and contesting to take your giveaways to the next
                level. Keep in mind, you want to include a clear CTA (call to

                Host an AMA (ask me anything). This is a great way to engage
                your audience and gather valuable insights for future content.
                Create an evergreen campaign by hosting a weekly, monthly, or
                quarterly AMA and invite providers to take part. This increases
                your reach, adds a level of dynamics to the feature, and allows

                You can use in-house providers or yourself (as the business
                owner) as the subject of your takeover. This showcases the
                people behind the brand, connecting you to your audience on a
                deeper level. Use video and images to show BTS footage of your
                salon or spa to give potential new guests a look into your
                business. Build out an evergreen campaign of weekly or monthly
                takeovers to get your audience excited about your brand
                and upcoming content.

                Different than a co-marketed giveaway or influencer partnership,
                brand collaborations are when you team up with one more business
