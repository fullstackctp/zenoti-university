            Setting your business up on social media can be a daunting task,

              Include convenient call to action buttons, which visitors and
              followers can tap to make contact or do business with you. These
              can be added to your profile.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Post content, particularly Stories, often - 2-3 x per week is a
              great place to start, just make sure all content is on brand and
              relevant to your audience.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Feed content should look curated and be aesthetically pleasing
              both as standalone content, and when seen together on the grid
              (your profile).
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Check your DMs regularly for any customer inquiries or to
              collaborate with relevant influencers.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Respond to any questions or comments on your feed promptly.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Create a branded or personalized hashtag (#) - for example
              BeautyFix Med Spa (shown below) uses #GetYourBeautyFix and
              encourages anyone talking about their salon to use this # so
              that they can track it and see relevant posts.

              Your Insights page, which you can access through your profile,
              offers a detailed view of how content is performing. Insights
              for Stories are available for up to 14 days after Stories
              appear. This can help you better understand if your content is

              Facebook and Instagram are both owned by the same company, and
              therefore can be linked and integrated to make managing your
              social media easier. Instagram is best, and most commonly, used

                    Similar to Facebook, Instagram crops your profile picture
                    into a circle. It is recommended to use your logo as your
                    profile picture, or a photo that includes your brand name.
                    The dimensions for Instagram are 320 x 320 pixels.

            Setting up a Facebook Page for your brand or business is an

          <ul class="bullets">
            <li class="text-justify">
              As soon as your Facebook Business Page is set up, post content
              that is engaging and informative. Use photos and videos to liven
              it up and maintain an active presence, posting 1-2 x per week.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              You can repost Instagram Stories to Facebook too.

            <li class="text-justify">
              Respond to any Facebook messages or comments as promptly and
              professionally as possible - checking this three times a day
              (morning, lunchtime, before end of business) will ensure you
              keep on top of it.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Join relevant industry groups to see what people are talking
              about. There are Facebook Groups for just about anything, so
              search your specialty and location and find a good fit for your
              business.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Depending on what kind of products or services your business
              has, you can utilize special features that Facebook offers. For
              example, there are options to include a menu or services list
              where you could showcase a spa offering.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Click on the Insights tab at the top of your Facebook Page to
              see how your audience is engaging. This will show you how many
              people you are reaching, and which content is resonating best.
              This step is imperative if you want to learn what works and
              continually improve your social content strategy.

                  smartphones. Must be at least 400 pixels wide and 150 pixels
                  tall. This will show smaller on mobile, so do not have any
                  crucial elements close to the top or bottom borders.

                  You can also upload video files and create a cover video, so

              <div class="my-1">
                <p class="text-justify">
                  As you can see in the image above, Chatters added a ‘Book
                  Now’ button on their page that drives traffic straight
                  through to a booking portal for their salons. You can select
                  different button actions depending on what you want your
                  visitors to do. For example, you can link directly to a
                  website or add a phone button so that your page visitors are
                  more inclined to call your business. If you are offering
                  services, ‘Book Now’ is the best button to use, but if you
                  do not have online booking ‘Contact Us’ is the next best
                  option.

          <h3>Getting Started</h3>
          <p class="mt-3 text-justify">
            Pinterest is a visual platform that allows users to gather
            inspiration on subjects that they are interested in and collect
            them in specialized Boards.
            <a class="text_underline" href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/pinterest-statistics/">60% of Pinterest
              users are women</a>, which
            makes it an engaging place for spas, salons and medspas
            who cater predominantly to women as well. Despite being slightly
            smaller than the other social media platforms, Pinterest users are
            <a class="text_underline" href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/pinterest-statistics/">three times more
              likely to click through to
              a company’s
              website</a>
            than any other social platform.

          <h3>Best Practices</h3>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li class="text-justify">
              Create relevant Boards (no more than 10) that highlight your
              services and tap into industry trends (we will dive deeper into
              this in our Social Media Content Creation and Curation module).
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">

            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Utilize Analytics to view impressions, engagements, clicks,
              views and so much more. You can also select specific date ranges
              and view all your pins or only the pins saved from your website.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">

                  Pinterest then requires you to give some details about what
                  industry you are in, and what your goals are for using their
                  platform. It will follow up with the below form to ask
                  further questions about your industry and advertising on
                  Pinterest - it is fine to select that you do not know at

                  Following the above, you will be asked what you want to do

                  Use a similar bio on Pinterest as on Twitter or Instagram,
                  it should be short but engaging and informative. For
                  example, Reign salon below:

                <p class="text-justify">
                  The dimensions for a Pinterest profile picture are 160 x 160
                  pixels, they will also be cropped circular. A logo is
                  perfect for this.

          <h3>Getting Started</h3>
          <p class="mt-3 text-justify">
            As mentioned in Module 1, TikTok is the up-and-coming short video
            platform that is heating up faster than the best curling iron.
            TikTok beauty content that goes viral has been generating serious
            sales for brands. For example, Deciem’s The Ordinary recently saw
            a
            <a class="text_underline" href="https://www.glossy.co/beauty/tiktok-takes-off-among-beauty-brands/">426%

          <h3>Best Practices</h3>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li class="text-justify">
              Be more relaxed and fun when using TikTok, short, lively videos
              are the best way to utilize this platform.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Use hashtag challenges to encourage people to engage – sharing a
              video of you undertaking it at the salon and including the
              campaign hashtag will attract more viewers to your page.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Branded lenses come in all shapes and sizes – TikTok lets you
              create your own face filters and objects, allowing potential
              clients to have fun with them, while at the same time improving
              their bond with your brand.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Record salon processes, whether it be a before and after skin
              treatment, or a fun new hairstyle, this type of content will
              resonate well on TikTok.
