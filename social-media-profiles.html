          <h3>Best Practices</h3>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li class="text-justify">
              Include convenient call to action buttons, which visitors and
              followers can tap to make contact or do business with you. These
              can be added to your profile.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Post content, particularly Stories, often - 2-3 x per week is a
              great place to start, just make sure all content is on brand and
              relevant to your audience.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Feed content should look curated and be aesthetically pleasing
              both as standalone content, and when seen together on the grid
              (your profile).
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Check your DMs regularly for any customer inquiries or to
              collaborate with relevant influencers.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Respond to any questions or comments on your feed promptly.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Create a branded or personalized hashtag (#) - for example
              BeautyFix Med Spa (shown below) uses #GetYourBeautyFix and
              encourages anyone talking about their salon to use this # so
              that they can track it and see relevant posts.

              Utilize the Stories option to show more live and ‘in the moment’
              style video and image content (more on this in our Social Media
              Content Creation and Curation module!). These Stories can be
              highlighted and categorized on your profile to make it easy to
              see different aspects of your offering. For example,
              <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thenowmassage/" class="text_underline">The NOW massage boutique</a>
              has used a branded cover on each:

            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Your Insights page, which you can access through your profile,
              offers a detailed view of how content is performing. Insights
              for Stories are available for up to 14 days after Stories
              appear. This can help you better understand if your content is
              reaching the right audience and how they are engaging.

              Build up your Instagram following and community by following
              relevant accounts. For example, other medspas or salons, or the

            <h3>Profile Set Up</h3>
            <p class="mt-3 text-justify">
              Facebook and Instagram are both owned by the same company, and
              therefore can be linked and integrated to make managing your
              social media easier. Instagram is best, and most commonly, used
              on mobile, so the following steps are intended to be completed
              on mobile.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Download the Instagram app.
              </li>
              <li>
                Set up or create a new account.
              </li>
              <li>
                Create a username that includes your business name.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add a profile name that helps people discover your account. This can be your business name or industry.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add a profile photo that is or includes your logo. The dimensions for an Instagram profile photo are 320
                x 320 pixels.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add your bio. The bio is 150 words or less and is where you add information about who you are what you
                do.
              </li>
            </ol>

              <p class="mb-0" style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.875rem">
                <strong>Tip: Keep your bio short and snappy, and where appropriate use emojis to
                  break up text. </strong>
              </p>
            </div>
            <p class="text-justify">In addition to these steps, you also want to include a call to action (CTA) within
              your profile. This is what visitors and followers can tap to contact your business, such as a link to your
              website or booking page. You can change this anytime. For example, if you have any campaigns running where
              you want to link to a specific location or landing page.</p>

          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">Setting up a Facebook Page for your brand or business is an important step in

          <p class="mt-3 text-justify">
            Access the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/creation/?ref=fbb_set_up_your_page"
              class="text_underline" target="_blank">link to set up a Facebook Business Page here</a>. Then follow these steps to set up
            your profile:
          </p>
          <ul class="bullets list-number">
            <li class="text-justify">Name your page. Your Facebook Business Page should be named after your brand or an
              identifiable name that people would use to search for your business online. </li>
            <li class="text-justify">Add your contact information. Ensure all your contact information is up to date so
              that your audience can connect with you through and outside of Facebook. Setting up an additional email to
              handle any social media inquiries may also be helpful to manage your business’ digital presence better.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">Create your “About” section. The About section is where you give background on your
              business, explain what you do, and why. You can have some fun with this section and let your brand tone of
              voice shine through. </li>
            <li class="text-justify">Add a profile and cover photo. Choose photos that represent your business and brand
              and include your logo so you can be easily identified. The dimensions for a Facebook profile photo display
              at 170 x 170 pixels on computers, 128 x 128 pixels on smartphones, and 36 x 36 pixels on most mobile
              phones and will be cropped circular. Typically, a 1:1 aspect ratio works best. Cover photos display at 820
              pixels x 312 pixels on computers and 640 pixels x 360 pixels on smartphones. </li>
            <li class="text-justify">Add a CTA. You can select different button actions depending on what you want your
              visitors to do. For example, you can link directly to a website or add a phone button so that your page
              visitors are more inclined to call your business. If you are offering services, ‘Book Now’ is the best
              button to use, but if you do not have online booking ‘Contact Us’ is the next best option. </li>

          <p class="mt-3 text-justify">
            Pinterest is a visual platform that allows users to gather inspiration on subjects that they are interested
            in and collect them on specialized Boards. <a class="text_underline"
              href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/pinterest-statistics/" target="_blank">60% of Pinterest users are women</a>,
            which makes it an engaging
            place for spas, salons and medspas who cater predominantly to women as well. Despite being slightly smaller
            than the other social media platforms, Pinterest users are <a class="text_underline"
              href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/pinterest-statistics/" target="_blank">three times more likely to click
            through to a
            company’s website</a> than any other social platform.

          <h3>Profile Set Up</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">Pinterest then requires you to give some details about what industry you are in, and
            what your goals are for using their platform. It will follow up with a step-by-step form to ask further
            questions about your industry and advertising on Pinterest - it is fine to select that you do not know at
            this time. </p>
          <ul class="bullets list-number">
            <li class="text-justify">
              Create a Pinterest business account. Use the Pinterest form to enter your business name, website,
              location, and language details.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Describe your business. Select your focus and goals for using Pinterest.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Build a bio. Use a similar bio to Instagram or Facebook. It should be short but engaging and informative.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Add a profile picture. The dimensions for a Pinterest profile picture are 160 x 160 pixels and it will be
              cropped circular. A logo is perfect for this.
            </li>
          </ul>

            TikTok is the up-and-coming short video platform that is heating up faster than the best curling iron.
            TikTok beauty content that goes viral has been generating serious sales for brands. For example, Deciem’s
            The Ordinary recently saw a <a class="text_underline"
              href="https://www.glossy.co/beauty/tiktok-takes-off-among-beauty-brands/" target="_blank">426% sales spike</a> in its
            AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution after the product
