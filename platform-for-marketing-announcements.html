                                Your website IS your marketing tool. It is a simple and effective way to showcase
                                everything that you want your guests (current and future) to be aware of. It is your
                                opportunity to brag about why you are
                                the best and how the value of being a guest of yours is better than the competition.

                                Your website is a great place to share what is new and fresh about your business.
                                Everything from new services, new service providers, new locations, new partnerships,
                                and new products can be easily
                                viewed and accessed. Keeping your guests in the loop of what is fresh within your
                                company will keep your business new and exciting.

                                        Your website has a lot of real estate, and that space is best utilized when it
                                        features some of your most popular promotions and campaigns.
                                    </strong>

                                Whether you are highlighting your loyalty program, Refer-a-Friend campaign, or gift card
                                promotion, you are appealing to the customer’s desire to save money and feel like they
                                are a part of something. In
                                the eyes of your guest, there are values in promotions.

                                A successful marketing announcement calls for an action. “Click here” or “buy now”
                                buttons make it convenient for guests and generate sales for your business. Utilizing
                                banners, side panels, and imbedded
                                URLs ensures that the guest on your website knows there is an opportunity to maximize
                                upon their appointment value.

                                        One of the best advantages of marketing online is that it is more cost-effective
                                        than traditional marketing.
                                    </strong>
                                </p>

                            <p>
                                With traditional marketing you are paying to print and distribute marketing materials.
                                Every time you run a new promotion, update your service menu or revamp a program you
                                must invest in reprinting new
                                materials. When marketing on your website it is as simple as removing one image and
                                replacing it with another, with little turnaround time. This means you can rest easy
                                knowing your guests have access to
                                updated information and are aware of current promotions and offerings.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Remember, your website it accessible to anyone, at any time. Prospective guests are
                                viewing your website and if they like what they see they can request to connect with
                                your business. Perhaps they enter
                                their email address to be included in future communications from your salon or spa.
                                Voila! They are now on your mailing list, even if they have never received a service
                                from you. By making sure that
                                prospective guests have a way to connect with you, you capture them for the future.
