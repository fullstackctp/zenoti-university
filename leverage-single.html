                                    When guests consistently choose your business over a competitor that offers similar
                                    services or products, they are loyal to your brand. Their purchase decision is less
                                    influenced by price or availability but instead from relationships they have built
                                    or positive experiences they have had with your salon or spa previously.

                                    Therefore, if a customer is loyal, they aren’t easily influenced to switch to a new
                                    brand based on short-term benefits. Instead, they value the quality and familiarity
                                    of your brand, which they are already established with. It's important not to
                                    underestimate the value of this loyalty.

                                    Loyalty programs have evolved significantly over the last decade, with the advent of
                                    new technologies, and now come in a number of different styles and formats. From
                                    points for dollar spend, to referral rewards, and social media shares, there’s a
                                    loyalty program to suit every need and business goal. Ultimately, the continued and
                                    growing popularity of loyalty programs across multiple industries indicates its high
                                    business value.

                                        Our data also shows that unsurprisingly they spend 6-7 times as much in a year
                                        as the guests who visit 3 or fewer times, and even on a per visit basis they
                                        tend to spend more than average.

                                        Our data clearly displays the business value that loyal customers have. Not only
                                        are they coming back time and time again but they actually spend more once
                                        there. This ties back to our earlier point about loyal customers being more
                                        receptive to product recommendations and upsells.

                                In today’s digital world you are continuously competing for
                                your customer’s attention and loyalty. With data and
                                segmentation technologies, your competitors are able to target
                                your customer base with ads across their social media and
                                search channels at any time of the day. A loyalty program
                                encourages customers to ignore these temptations by showing
                                them how valued they are at your brand.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-justify">
                                We're all human and naturally enjoy a little recognition every
                                now and then. If a customer comes back to your salon over and
                                over, they’ll undoubtedly appreciate a little thank you or
                                reward. Recognizing these customers may be easy if you are a
                                small single center but as your brand grows and you hire more
                                team members this can get tricky.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-justify">
                                Hence, having a clearly defined program which gives out loyalty
                                points towards products or services is a simple, yet highly
                                effective way of showing this appreciation. The whole purpose of this model is to reward
                                your best customers - after all the data shows these are most
                                profitable.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-justify">
                                Beyond just thanking customers for their loyalty, the program
                                does serve other purposes. You are also able to collect
                                information on their preferences, likes and dislikes, and
                                personal information which helps you to build a tailored,
                                personalized experience.

                                Now, when the triggers for them to leave do occur – like a new

                                employee– you don’t immediately lose them. These customers
                                will continue to be loyal to your brand since they are
                                incentivized to continue earning and redeeming points.

                                A loyalty program can also be beneficial for encouraging
                                guests to engage in behaviors that will further help your
                                brand while making them feel valued and rewarded.

                                    Giving points if they book an appointment during off peak
                                    hours or quiet days. For example, if Tuesdays are your least
                                    profitable day, and you often have unfilled appointments, then
                                    you could extend your loyalty program so that guests earn
                                    extra points if they book an appointment on this day. This
                                    form of loyalty program helps you to optimize your resource
                                    utilization and increase revenue.

                                    and their opinion matters, but gives you the opportunity to
                                    address any negative feedback and make improvements to avoid
                                    repeat instances. In this example you would avoid losing
                                    this customer and receive important learnings for the
                                    future.

                                    looking to lighten the load or cut costs at the front desk.

                                    – win-win.
