                  The experience a guest has with your website is even more
                  important than the experience that they have in your center.
                  This is because
                  <b
                    >your website is open to the world 24 hours a day, 7 days a
                    week</b
                  >. This means it has the capability to reach more people which
                  is a great thing for your brand awareness, but have you ever
                  stopped to consider what first impression those visitors get
                  when they land on your home page?

                  Within the first fifteen seconds the user needs to know what
                  you do and be convinced that you’re the best at it. Whether
                  you are trying to attract business executives, busy parents,
                  or savvy college students, you will not get far if your
                  website experience is poor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If your website is frustrating, the guest is not going to
                  chance walking through your doors. If the experience is
                  seamless and guest friendly, they will associate your salon
                  with being guest centric as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Consider what else a user may see when they enter your landing
                  page.

                  <li>
                    Can they see what you’ve curated on your social media?

                  <li>
                    If guests are asking questions or providing feedback, are
                    you responding so that your community can see your business
                    is responsible and provides follow-through?
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Digital interactions should mirror your in-person
                  interactions. You would never think to not call an upset guest
                  back, so why would you leave someone hanging online?

                <p class="mb-0">
                  Finally, prospective guests want to see your photo gallery. If
                  you do not have one, that can be a huge red flag. You sell a
                  look, whether it is clear skin, beautiful nails, or healthy
                  hair, if you are not showcasing your photos on your website,
                  you are not promoting what it is that you do best.

                  Online presence is an amazing tool, but for every reward there
                  is a risk. The risk? If your website is not designed properly,
                  it will drive guests away from considering you in the future.
