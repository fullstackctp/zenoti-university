            Your guest begins their experience with you the instant that they
            walk into your salon or spa. From the moment that the door opens
            their senses awaken to the experience, on both a conscious and
            subconscious level.

          <p>
            They inhale the aromas, they hear the purr of a blow dryer, they
            see friendly, smiling faces, and most importantly they feel a
            sense of relief because they know that for the next hour or so,
            they have nothing to do but be pampered.
          </p>

            them for making the effort to get there is to provide them with
            the best service and the most amazing guest experience. How can

              That’s why delighting your guests is as important as the
              technical service that you provide. You can be the best at your
              craft, but if your business is not offering the best guest
              service, they may not consider you for their next appointment.

              When your guests leave your center, you want them to walk out

              You want them to rate you 10 out of 10 and tell anyone who will

            <p>
              Let’s not forget why the guest has chosen to come to see you in
              the first place - to receive incredible service. Guests are
              looking for a well-executed service that incorporates all the
              right products and recommendations that are customized for them.
              A passion for education and sharing knowledge can make a big
              impact on a guest.
            </p>
            <p>
              That is why consultations are one of the strongest tools that
              you have for your appointments. To properly prepare for the
              consultation, use their guest history, available in your
              Zenoti Employee Mobile App, to gain valuable insights into their goals, needs, and
              desired outcome.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              We recommend looking for the following details:
            </p>
            <div class="img-box-r-card section-padding-2 text-center">
              <img src="img/placeholder.png" class="w-75 img-responsive" />
            </div>
            <p class="section-padding-3">
              When you do your homework prior to the consultation, you can
              uncover a lot about what the guest may need and create a
              personalized plan that is suitable for them, based on their
              routine and tendencies.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, “Your last haircut was ten weeks ago. I am going to
              recommend that you rebook eight weeks from today so we can
              prevent your ends from splitting”.
            </p>
            <p>
              The consultation is the moment in the service where the guest's
              goals and your technical services align. A thorough consultation
              gives you the opportunity to clearly understand their intention
              for seeing you and gives you the opportunity to provide
              solutions to reach their desired result.
            </p>
            <p>
              The consultation creates a roadmap for their service, one that
              you’re both aligned on. Without it, you are more likely to get
              lost along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
              A thoughtful service provider is in tune with the cues of their
              guest. Pay attention to both verbal and nonverbal cues and
              <b>if you feel that there is a disconnect, make an
                adjustment.</b>
              You can also choose to include the guest throughout the service
              by asking questions.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, ask how they feel about the pressure of your
              massage, consult with them on the length before you take the
              first snip, ask them how they feel about a heavy highlight in
              their bangs. Including your guest shows them their look is a
              collaboration and you care about making sure that you hit the
              mark.
            </p>
            <div class="img-box-r-card section-padding-2 text-center">
              <img src="img/quality2.png" class="w-50 img-responsive" />
            </div>
            <p class="section-padding-3">
              Once your technical service is complete, there’s one final step
              you need to take before your guest leaves the chair.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              <strong> We call it the 3 Rs. </strong>
            </p>
            <div class="img-box-r-card section-padding-2 text-center">
              <img src="img/placeholder.png" class="w-75 img-responsive" />
            </div>
            <p class="section-padding-3">
              By recapping, recommending, and rebooking chairside, those
              elements become part of the service. Once the guest stands up,
              they are mentally “checked-out” and already thinking about their
              next venture. Employees can use their
              Employee Mobile App to add products to the guest shopping cart and to rebook for
              the next service.
            </p>
            <p>
              This eliminates work for the front desk and adds an additional
              touch from the service provider to the guest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Service providers should also encourage guests to download the
              Customer Mobile App, which gives them the ability to stay
              connected and to book or adjust appointments anywhere, at any
              time, from the convenience of their mobile device.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>By educating the guest on convenient ways to engage with your
                salon you’re telling them, “You’re a valuable guest of mine,
                and I want you to have the right tools to make your experience
                seamless and easy.”</b>
            </p>
            <p class="MB-0">
              The guest should feel welcomed back by you and getting their
              appointment on the books is a great way to say, “I can’t wait to
              see you again”.

        People love to be recognized. It indicates respect and consideration.
        Something as simple as addressing a guest by their name can make a
        huge impact on their experience. So, when you greet a guest for the
        first time ask them how they would like to be addressed and save their
        preferences in their profile, ensuring that when they come to visit
        you everyone addresses them appropriately.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>No two guests are the same and for that reason, no two appointments
          are the same.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some guests come to you for peace and quiet, and an opportunity to
        relax. Others want to share their world with you and spend much of the
        appointment talking about themselves. You may have had the pleasure of
        providing a service to a guest on one of the best days of their lives,
        or the opportunity to provide comfort on one of the worst days.
        Customizing each appointment based on the guest’s needs will put you
        in sync with them and build trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          The time with you becomes more than an appointment, you become their
          beauty professional.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        You have addressed the guest by their name, and you have successfully
        read cues on how they want to interact with you. Now it is time to
        listen, really listen. Remembering tiny details about their lives that
        they have shared with you is a major WOW. And don’t worry, you are not
        expected to have the memory of an elephant. You can utilize notes
        which will help to trigger reminders of conversations and tidbits that
        your guest has shared with you. Here are a few examples:
      </p>
      <div class="img-box-r-card section-padding-2 text-center">
        <img src="img/placeholder.png" class="w-75 img-responsive" />
      </div>
      <p class="section-padding-3">
        <strong>
          Imagine you walk into a salon, for only the second time, and
          upon arrival, you’re addressed by your name. How good would
          that feel?
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Zenoti customers are now able to include a profile photograph
        for each of their guests. Attaching a photo allows for service
        providers, receptionists, and support staff to recognize a guest
        the moment that they see them. They don’t have to be worried
        that they might greet the wrong person or call a guest by the
        wrong name. It’s a small detail that will surprise and delight
        the guest.
      </p>
      <p>
        A guest also needs to feel like their provider is an expert at
        their look.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <strong> How is that achieved? </strong>
      </h4>
      <p class="section-padding-3">
        By being genuine in your recommendations based on what they need
        to achieve their goals. Products and service add-ons are not
        “one size fits all”, and each appointment should be customized
        for that guest. Even if the guest is not able to make any
        additional investment at the time of the visit, the effort you
        made to talk with them about their look is sure to make a
        lasting impression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personalizing the experience makes them feel like they are a
        VIP. It is an experience that they will share with their friends
        and one that they will be eager to have again as soon as
        possible. By personalizing their visit, and remembering small
        details of their life, you show them how much you value them as
        your guest.

              Beyond visual cues, your guests are picking up on the vibe of
              your center using all their available senses. Every detail
              matters, from the music you play throughout the day, to the
              salon lighting, to the aromas and any refreshments you offer. It
              all matters, because these details are what paint a picture in
              the memories of your guests.

              One additional way to check the ambience of your space is to
              assess your needs for repair and maintenance. Get your team
              members on board to report issues as they notice them. Guests
              may be forgiving to a broken piece of equipment at the time of
              their visit, but if they return six weeks later to see that it’s
              still broken, they will question the level of care that you put
              into your business.
            </p>
            <p>
              For a spa guest, the center atmosphere is as important as ever.
              Your space should replicate the same serenity that you want your
              guest to experience. Plush robes, treatment table warmers,
              dimmed lighting and soft music are all small touches that can
              elevate the experience of relaxation for the guest. Encourage
              your staff to adapt to a “spa voice” when walking through your
              hallways so that relaxing guests are not disturbed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Spa appointments may require intake forms or questionnaires
              prior to the start of the service. By utilizing
              <b>digital forms,</b> guests can fill out all necessary
              paperwork in advance from the convenience of their phone or
              computer, and the information that they provide will be stored
              in their guest profile. This enables them to relax when they
              come for their treatment, and eliminates the eyesore of
              clipboards, pens, and paper scattered about in an otherwise
              tranquil spa.

            <p>
              When considering ambience, it’s important to be mindful of all
              the marketing in your space. Allow your spa to be an escape from
              reality and sales pitches. The guest, at any point, does not
              want to feel inundated by your promotions and campaigns.
            </p>
            <p>
              By utilizing <b>digital marketing campaigns</b> (text messages,
              emails, website marketing) you can clean up the marketing from
              your center. Additionally, any marketing you do have in your
              salon and spa will have more impact because it is not
              overcrowded. Highlighting too many promotions at once loses its
              effectiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pay attention to your retail shelves as well. Not only should
              they be clean and stocked, but they should be set up in a
              strategic manner. Keep your best-selling brands and products at
              eye level for an easy shopping experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can have everything in tip-top shape, not a single towel out
              of place, but if your staff is not welcoming and friendly, your
              ambience won’t be either. Genuine smiles and warm greetings show
              a guest that you’re glad they’re there.
            </p>
            <p>
              Small gestures, like complimenting the work of a co-worker,
              sweeping their station, or asking if there is anything that you
              can do to help them on a hectic day, are all examples of
              teamwork that a guest would like to see. It gives your guest a
              glimpse of a strong team culture that you worked hard to build.
              When a guest feels that the employees of a business are
              committed to the brand, it makes them want to commit in return.

            We are all consumers, and we make choices every day about where we
            spend our time and money. Would you continue to visit a restaurant
            if you knew that the food makes you sick? Would you continue to
            use a product after it was recalled or drive a car if it didn’t
            pass a safety test? Probably not.

          <p>
            If your guests don’t feel safe when they come to your salon or
            spa, nothing else matters. Beauty providers are typically

            By implementing tools such as the

            and online booking, your guests can bypass interacting with front
            desk staff and limit any extra time spent in the waiting area.
            This ensures safety by keeping physical contact limited to their
            personal device and eliminates any transfer of germs on frequently
            touched objects, like pens and point-of-sale equipment.
