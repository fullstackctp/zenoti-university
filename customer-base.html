              Today’s gift is tomorrow’s guest. And today’s gift is, of course,
              a gift card! Gift card sales are a wonderful indicator of future
              business and a crucial revenue-building tool.
            </p>
            <p>How crucial?</p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 2rem !important">
              <li>
                In 2019, U.S. guests spent $190 billion dollars (about $580 per
                person) on gift card purchases.
              </li>
              <li>
                70% of all U.S. consumers claim to have bought a gift card as a
                present during a holiday season.
              </li>
              <li>
                65% of guests who receive a gift card spend 40% more than the
                card value.
              </li>
              <li>
                Brands who offer Zenoti gift cards see over 180% jump in gift
                card revenue during holiday months.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Not only is this a significant amount of revenue to miss out on if
              you don’t sell gift cards, but research shows they actually
              influence the future of your brand too. This is because 11% of
              guests aged 18 to 34 are more likely to visit a brand they
              wouldn’t otherwise visit because they have received gift card.

              safe, touchless technology solutions that enabled businesses to

              Modern guests take their time when choosing which brand to visit.
              Accessing your website enables them to browse without feeling as
              if they are imposing on a receptionist. And the reality is, your
              front desk team is probably unable to spent ten minutes speaking
              with every guest that calls to book.
            </p>
            <p>
              With this in mind, your website still needs to replicate the same
              extraordinary experience the guest would get when speaking with
              the front desk or entering your center.
            </p>
            <p>
              What does the guest see? Is there a flow? Is there an intuitive
              user experience? Is it clear where they should be going to access
              what they’re looking for?
            </p>
            <p>
              If your website is not guest centric, chances are they will not
              take the time to learn if your salon or spa is guest centric.

              Finally, keep in mind that different generations have different
              opinions and behaviors when it comes to using the internet.
              Perhaps teenagers aren’t your target demographic currently, but
              they are your future business. So, remember that the services and
              programs that they are offered now will affect your ability to
              gain their loyalty.

              Implementing a referral program may be an easy solution for an
              expensive problem. If your guests are thinking about referring
              their friends and family, then give them a push to do so! It’s not
              just one extra guest you can expect to meet, it’s almost triple
              that since research shows that every referrer makes an average of
              <a

                target="_blank"
                >2.68 referrals.</a
              >
              Don’t forget, the guests referred to your business will spend more
              in their lifetime of conducting business with you than guests who
              were not referred.

                  Ultimately, if you want to grow your brand, you must grow your
                  network. While valuable, your existing guest base will only
                  take you so far.

                  For every new guest you welcome, and rebook, you are building
                  loyalty and growing your database of brand ambassadors.
                  Committing to strategies like gift cards, marketing,
                  establishing an online presence, and referrals will encourage
                  new guests to visit your salon or spa. What you do once
                  they’re there is up to you.
