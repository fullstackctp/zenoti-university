                    Acquiring new customers comes with a price tag. It is anywhere from 
                    5 to 25%
                    more costly to acquire a new customer than it is to retain an existing one. And in fact, the cost of acquiring new customers has increased 
                    60%
                    in less than 10 years.

                    Yes, you want to attract new customers if you’re looking to expand your locations or increase your client base, so knowing the high cost involved, being as strategic as possible is key. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now that you know your ideal customer, your brand ethos, and the medium(s) you wish to use, it’s time to consider your strategy for both new and existing customers.

                  <p>
                    Attracting new customers to your brand is called acquisition marketing and while the elements may be the same, the intention is different. You want to invite people in through brand awareness and encourage them to complete your desired call to action (CTA).

                What’s the first thing you do before making an Amazon purchase? Most people will say - read the reviews. In fact, many people head to Amazon to read product reviews even if they end up purchasing from another retailer. Why? Because social proof is important.
