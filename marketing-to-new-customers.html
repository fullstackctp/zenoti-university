                    Yes, you want to attract new customers if you’re looking to
                    expand your locations or increase your client base, so
                    knowing the high cost involved, being as strategic as
                    possible is key.

                    Now that you know your ideal customer, your brand ethos, and

                    Attracting new customers to your brand is called acquisition
                    marketing and while the elements may be the same, the
                    intention is different. You want to invite people in through
                    brand awareness and encourage them to complete your desired
                    call to action (CTA).

                What’s the first thing you do before making an Amazon purchase?
                Most people will say - read the reviews. In fact, many people
                head to Amazon to read product reviews even if they end up
                purchasing from another retailer. Why? Because social proof is
                important. Very important. In fact,
