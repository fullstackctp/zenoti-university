                    they’re a requirement. Businesses such as
                    <b>Starbucks, Target, Macys, Nordstrom’s</b> and even
                    grocery stores have leveraged this growing trend to

                    of adults shopping online, and with recent travel

                    your guests where they’re at and provide them with what they

                  While experience can cover a broad range of activities, beauty
                  and wellness experiences are amongst the most meaningful that
                  can be accessed by people in a city at almost any time and
                  within easy reach

                  There’s growing interest in wellness and rejuvenation to
                  combat the stresses and impact of everyday life, and there’s a
                  significant opportunity for salons and spas to capture this
                  market through gift cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When your core business is built around making people look and
                  feel good, you’re one of the best places for your guests to
                  buy the gift of experience for their loved ones.

                <p>
                  This growing trend in gifting beauty and wellness services is
                  validated when we look at our customer data.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We looked at our top 10 customers with a focused gift card
                  program and found that their gift cards grew by XYZ percent
                  over last few years, making up ABC% of their overall revenue
                  <span style="color: red">(pending data from Sruthi)</span>.

                <p>
                  This highlights the impact gift cards are having on their
                  overall revenue and profitability.
