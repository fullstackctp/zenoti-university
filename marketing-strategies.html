            <b>Build a Blog</b>

          <p class="mt-3">
            Adding a blog or SEO-driven educational content to your website
            will help you rank higher on Google. It also provides open-source
            knowledge for your audience and solidifies your brand experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Set goals and key content pillars for your blog to ensure it is
            strategic and adding value to your overall strategy. Consider
            whether you want to be somewhere that customers come for the tips
            on caring for their hair or skin or do you want to be a source of
            industry knowledge and insights. Or even both!
          </p>
          <p>
            Take a look at the
            Zenoti blog ,
            we strive to share thoughtful industry insights, tips for salon
            and spa owners, and updates on our philanthropic work so our

          <p class="mt-3">
            According to statistics from Later.com, over the next 6 years
            social commerce is estimated to increase by 31.4% every year,
            reaching $604.5 billion (about $1,900 per person in the US) by
            2027.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider connecting with your current clients or your ideal client
            on social media for an influencer campaign.

          <p class="fst-italic">
            Take Ashley, a beauty influencer for example.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her reach is over
            120K on Instagram and
            22K
            on YouTube. Working with an influencer in your area who has
            like-minded values can be instrumental to your salon or spa
            marketing. It’s more than just a numbers game, look to make
            authentic connections with
            nano, micro, and/or macro-influencers.

            Your email list is one constant in a world of ever-changing

            and they are instrumental to growing your business. Email is a way
            to engage with your existing client base. And a way to excite
            potential new clients about connecting with your brand, so plan
            for a regular cadence of emails.

            based on their visit history to encourage them to come in for an
            appointment.
