            Once you’ve launched your website, you have access to data which
            can help you to better understand how it is performing. You’ll
            have insights into most visited pages and where people are
            bouncing off to help you identify what should be refreshed and
            optimized to drive the best results.

                These insights provide a heat map for you to analyze the user
                behavior and the performance of your site at a glance.

            “Hot” areas gained the most traffic, guests either clicked,
            stopped scrolling, or spent an extended time on a particular page
            or part of your website. “Cold” areas are those where a guest
            spent the least amount of time, they did not effectively capture
            guest attention. Knowing how your website performs helps you to
            find answers on how to get site visitors to convert to purchasing
            and/or booking.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            Website performance insights can also tell you a lot about your
            online booking process. You can identify at which point in the
            online experience the guest dropped off. To do this consider these
            steps:
          </p>
          <!-- img -->
          <div class="imgCardleverage section-padding-2">
            <img src="img/placeholder.png" class="img-responsive w-100" />
          </div>
          <!-- end -->
          <p class="mt-3">
            By analyzing each step of the booking process, you can identify
            where individuals are dropping off (which points to this step
            needing improvement) and gain insight into how many users started
            the process compared to number of successful bookings. With this
            knowledge you can continue to enhance and improve your website,
            and your business.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are choosing to feature Ecommerce on your website, you can
            also track the performance of product sales. Are your top sellers
            the same as those in-salon? Do the reviews reflect the number of
            sales? Of guests that purchased online, how many returned to
            purchase a second time?
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on the performance on the website you can determine what
            products guests are drawn to, even when a service provider is not
            there to make a recommendation. Perhaps those products deserve a
            spotlight in-salon?
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, website performance insights serve as the “fly on the
            wall”. You suddenly have visibility into success rates and can
            better determine which promotions drive the most business, which
            part of the booking process loses the most guests and how many of
            your appointments are booked online. By understanding how guests
            interact with your website you can identify trends and optimize
            for further engagement.

                Whether your guest is walking through the front doors of your
                salon or spa or visiting your website for the first time, they
                are forming a first impression of your brand. Failing to
                dedicate the time and energy into building a positive website
                experience leaves a lasting first impression - and not the
                good kind!

                A guest decides in fifteen seconds if they are going to shop
                on your site, how are you going to make the most of those
                valuable seconds?
