                  It’s your goal to nurture these guest relationships and keep
                  guests coming back — but doing so takes more than exemplary
                  service alone. So, to help, we’ve developed a course that
                  provides an overview of the key elements of guest
                  loyalty, along with six proven ways that you can effectively
                  retain your guests.

          <p class="mt-3">
            If you’re already providing high-quality procedures, maintenance
            tips and tricks, and great service, you might be wondering why
            it’s so important to take additional steps to retain your guests.
          </p>
          <p>Let us explain:</p>
          <!-- ul li  -->
          <ul class="padding-left-ul list-number mb-0" style="padding-left: 2rem !important">
            <b>
              <li>Acquiring new customers is expensive.</li>
            </b>
            <ul class="list-none drive-sale-inner-ul list-none mb-3">
              <li class="mt-1">
                You worked hard to build your current guest base and it likely
                wasn’t cheap to do so. In fact, it can cost
                5x more
                to acquire a new guest than to retain an existing one. That's
                why your goal should be to keep customers loyal by offering
                exemplary guest service and programs that they will find
                valuable. With only
                30% of guests likely to return after their first visit, it’s essential that
                you employ tools that guarantee their return.

              <li class="mt-1">
                Did you know that repeat business from happy guests is the
                biggest contributor to revenue? Our customer data shows that
                over 77% of a spa or salon’s revenue comes from guests who
                have visited over four times in a year. Cultivating their
                loyalty and maximizing their participation in your programs
                and offerings is important to your business. The more that you
                can drive their frequency of visit, and get them involved in
                what you offer, the more committed they'll be to your brand.

                Your existing guest base is integral to your business
                ecosystem.

            <ul class="list-none drive-sale-inner-ul">
              <li class="mt-1">
                Why? Your current guests are some of your brand’s biggest
                ambassadors. They love their experience with you, and they are
                not shy to share that experience with their network. That's a
                huge compliment — but above all, it’s a huge contribution to
                business growth.
