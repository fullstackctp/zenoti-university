                  A loyalty program can also be beneficial for encouraging
                  guests to engage in behaviors that will further help your
                  brand while making them feel valued and rewarded.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">Some examples include:</p>
                <ul
                  class="mb-0 section-padding-3"
                  style="padding-left: 2rem !important"
                >
                  <li>
                    Giving points if they book an appointment during off peak
                    hours or quiet days. For example, if Tuesdays are your least
                    profitable day and you often have unfilled appointments then
                    you could extend your loyalty program so that guests earn
                    extra points if they book an appointment on this day. This
                    form of loyalty program helps you to optimize your resource
                    utilization and increase revenue.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Providing guests with points in exchange for feedback. This
                    not only indicates to guests that you are listening to them,
                    and their opinion matters but gives you the opportunity to
                    address any negative feedback and make improvements to avoid
                    repeat instances. In this example you would avoid losing
                    this customer and receive important learnings for the
                    future.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Encourage online bookings in exchange for loyalty points.
                    This is a particularly beneficial strategy if you are
                    looking to lighten the load or cut costs at the front desk.
                    Plus, data shows that guests who engage with your business
                    online and pay digitally spend more and visit more regularly
                    – win win.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Exchange points for certain retail products that aren’t
                    selling well . This strategy avoids lost revenue and builds
                    customer loyalty as the guests get a good deal on the
                    products.
