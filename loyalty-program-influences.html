                  A loyalty program can also be beneficial for encouraging guests to engage in behaviors that will further help your brand while making them feel valued and rewarded. 
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">Some examples include:</p>
                <ul
                  class="mb-0 section-padding-3"
                  style="padding-left: 2rem !important"
                >
                  <li>
                    Giving points if they book an appointment during off peak hours or quiet days. For example, if Tuesdays are your least profitable day and you often have unfilled appointments then you could extend your loyalty program so that guests earn extra points if they book an appointment on this day. This form of loyalty program helps you to optimize your resource utilization and increase revenue. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Providing guests with points in exchange for feedback. This not only indicates to guests that you are listening to them, and their opinion matters but gives you the opportunity to address any negative feedback and make improvements to avoid repeat instances. In this example you would avoid losing this customer and receive important learnings for the future. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Encourage online bookings in exchange for loyalty points. This is a particularly beneficial strategy if you are looking to lighten the load or cut costs at the front desk. Plus, data shows that guests who engage with your business online and pay digitally spend more and visit more regularly – win win.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Exchange points for certain retail products that aren’t selling well or are close to expiration. This strategy avoids lost revenue and builds customer loyalty as the guests get a good deal on the products.
