                                    A few decades ago, if one of your guests didn’t like the service they received or an
                                    interaction they had with your brand, you only risked them telling people in their
                                    immediate circle of influence — their family and friends. In today’s digital world,
                                    however, reviews are now a quick click away and are accessible anytime,
                                    anywhere, through multiple channels.
                                </p>
                                <p>One critical review has the potential to reach, and turn away, dozens, if not
                                    hundreds, of potential guests. This can negatively affect your business and your
                                    brand before
                                    someone ever sets foot in your spa or salon. That’s where the guest experience comes
                                    in. Creating a strong, branded guest
                                    experience isn’t just an integral part of your business — it’s the foundation of
                                    your success. A strong guest experience supports all the key elements of your
                                    business and makes
                                    your guests feel like VIPs at every interaction.

                                    In this course you’ll learn why a strong guest experience should be the

                                    of your business and the four essential parts of business it

                    <br>
                    <p>In the U.S. in 2014, there were 650,000 barbers, hairdressers, and cosmetologists. Schwartz
                        Cosmetics predicts that number will increase nearly 10% by 2024. So, even if you offer the best
                        haircuts, if the whole experience you give your guests doesn't exceed their expectations, then
                        they may not choose you a second time.

                                    The customer experience that you provide dictates your brand’s
                                    reputation. Having a bad reputation is detrimental to your business. This is because
                                    negative reviews spread twice as fast. So, even with recovery efforts, it will take
                                    twice as long to repair. Offering a five-star service coupled with a five-star guest
                                    experience is the basis of building a strong reputation and a strong business.

                                It’s all about how you make your guests feel. For example, when someone carries a
                                designer purse or drives a luxury electric vehicle, they are choosing that brand because
                                it makes them feel a strong sense of pride whenever they use it. That’s exactly how you
                                want your guests to feel about you.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                When one of your guests are asked, “where do you go for your hair color?” you want them
                                to glow with pride while they excitedly share everything about your business. You want
                                every single guest to have confidence that they belong to a salon or spa that’s not only
                                great at what it does, but that also gives them that VIP treatment they’re craving.
                                Then, and only then, will your brand reputation take on a positive shape and begin to
                                organically grow.

                                what do they look like? Are they walking tall and confidently? Are they glowing and
                                relaxed? Or do they seem uncomfortable and irritated?

                        At the end of the day, businesses dream of having a brand reputation that brings people to their
                        stores in lines out the door. But that kind of reputation and those “raving fans” don’t just
                        come by accident. Creating an unforgettable guest experience will go a long way in affecting how
                        your business is perceived and in positively building your reputation as a must-visit spa or
                        salon. How you treat your guests, and how they feel when they enter and leave your building
                        impacts every aspect of your business. Put this way, raving fans are your livelihood.</p>

                            Consider this: In most salons, the standard visit looks a lot like the guest comes in,
                            you chat a bit, then you get to work. Right? Do you see the problem with this picture?

                        <li>The consultation is one of the most underutilized parts of a guest’s appointment. If you
                            intentionally take advantage of this window of time in your service provider’s first
                            interactions with their guests, you’ll be elevating a key part of the guest experience
                            that can generate more spend per customer.

                            A proper consultation serves many purposes. It helps the service provider learn what the
                            guest feels that they need from the appointment and then aligns those goals with the
                            services they provide. But it also creates the perfect opportunity for service providers
                            to make valuable recommendations for enhancements. Not only will this give your guests a
                            better experience, but you’ll also get significantly more value from that appointment

                            Establish strong consultation practices that encourage your service providers to listen,
                            empathize, ask questions and provide solutions on how their guests can achieve their
                            hair and beauty goals. When your guests feel genuinely listened to, they will know
                            without a doubt that you have their best interests at heart. You will have invested your
                            time, your talent and your expertise with the guest. And in exchange, <strong>they will
                                invest in what you believe is best for them.</strong>

                            Consider your current consultation practices: If it only includes asking questions like,
                            “What are we doing today?” or, “Same thing as last time?” are you really meeting your
                            guest’s needs? Remember that the purpose of the consultation is to uncover their goal
                            during this time that they have with you. Try shifting away from generic, empty
                            questions and engaging in open-ended conversations that open the door for dialogue. For
                            example, a question like, “Tell me about your hair?” allows you to incorporate add-ons
                            and product recommendations seamlessly throughout the appointment.

                            Your guests want to be more than an appointment on your books. When you intentionally
                            build a rapport with your guests, you earn their trust, and in exchange they’re more
                            receptive to your recommendations. Whether those recommendations are enhanced services
                            or products for maintenance, they translate to a better experience for your guest, and
                            add more value to the appointment. The overall guest experience you offer, including the
                            consultation, has a direct effect on how much a guest will invest in you.

                    <p>
                        Retention is all about understanding how many guests are coming back to you for services, and
                        how many visited you once but didn’t return. It’s a key business metric that’s oftentimes
                        undervalued and overlooked when running a beauty or wellness business.
                    </p>

                    <p>But, <strong>an increase in guest retention will directly increase the profit and productivity of
                            your business.</strong>

                    <p>
                        And the proof is in the numbers. Salesforce reports that just “a 10% increase in customer
                        retention levels can increase the value of your company by 30%.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There are many factors that can affect the retention rates of your business — some are within
                        your control and some, quite frankly, aren’t. Focusing on those parts of business you can
                        control, like the guest experience, is key to increasing your retention rates.

                        You may be surprised to hear that the number one reason a guest decides to leave their
                        hairdresser is because they decided they’re ready for a change, and they don’t feel like their
                        hairdresser is willing or able to provide that change. A service provider should never be afraid
                        to ask a guest if they’ve thought about doing something new with their look. Asking questions is
                        good guest service.

                        In addition to opening the door to new possibilities with their look, you should also never be
                        afraid to share your accolades, certifications and specialties with your guests. If your guests
                        know you specialize in a particular service, you automatically add value to their appointment.
                        They may be more likely to request those services from you, whether today or at a future
                        appointment. For example, just because your guest may have never considered hair extensions or
                        smoothing treatments before does not mean they won’t consider them in the future.

                    <p>
                        Promoting guest-centric programs, like memberships and loyalty rewards, are another great way to
                        increase retention. Guest loyalty will grow as they feel valued and are incentivized to choose
                        your business. It’s a win-win situation!

                        Besides offering new ways for your guests to save money, you can also enhance guest experience
                        and increase retention by directly inviting the guest back in to see you. Not only does this
                        show them you enjoyed your time together and further strengthen relationships, but guests will
                        also start looking forward to spending more time with you in the future. Just as you would put a
                        wedding or a party in your calendar, you can save the date with your guest.

                    <p>
                        If you want to improve guest retention, then the experience that you offer needs to be
                        prioritized just as much as the service that you provide. They could have received an amazing

                        lived. But, once a guest feels that they are appreciated, a positive connection forms between
                        your business and that guest. And when that connection forms it becomes less about if they will
                        return and more about when they will return.

                        When a guest feels like their visit to your salon or spa was less about maintenance and more
                        about an experience, they’ll be more eager to return. While there are many benefits to having
                        loyal guests, the major takeaway is that loyal guests are the foundation of your business
                        thriving beyond the present and into the future.

                        Creating Brand Advocates
                    </h2>
                    </br>

                    <p>
                        Whether you use an iPhone or an Android, drink Coke or Pepsi, drive a Dodge or Chevy, you are
                        practicing brand loyalty every time you use that company’s products. And, as a loyal member of a
                        brand, you unconsciously spend each day championing that business.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Your business has its own set of champions — guests who receive amazing services and experiences
                        and tell people about it. The level of training that you possess, the friendlier that you are,
                        the more that you can surprise and delight, the more guest champions you will create. This is
                        extremely important because your champion guests are your marketing troops, and they do some of
                        the most valuable work for your business.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Marketing to a prospective guest can cost up to 5 times more than existing guests (Forbes). But
                        not if you’re encouraging current guests to be your guest champions. If
                        the service they received is top notch and the experience was superb your guests will talk about
                        it, post about it, or leave a flattering review.

                        Every guest of yours is your walking billboard, which is unique to our industry. It is your
                        responsibility to make sure that your guests are always looking their best. The guest experience
                        doesn’t stop at the chair. To ensure that your “free billboard” always displays your best work
                        it’s crucial to take the time to recommend products that will help them to recreate the look at
                        home. Be sure to also rebook their next appointment before they leave so they’re coming back in
                        at the right time to keep their look fresh.

                        You and your service providers chose this career path because of your desire to help people look
                        good and feel great. Creating a guest experience is about more than how your guests feel though.
                        It’s about multiplying the positive impacts you can have on your guests’ lives and on your
                        business’s future success.

                        You are just one business in a billion-dollar industry. There is competition all around you. If
                        you want guests to choose your business over any other, you must have <strong>talent coupled
                            with an ability to make your guests feel great during every part of their visit</strong>.
                        When your guests feel great, they will invest in your business, keep coming back to you,
                        recommend you to their closest friends and stand behind you and your brand. And that alone makes
                        building an unforgettable guest experience more than worth it.
