                  Marketing is an essential skill for any business owner.
                  Regardless of if you choose to work with a marketing team,
                  hire a marketing manager or do it for yourself,
                  understanding some timeless principles will help you build a
                  better marketing strategy to take your salon or spa to the
                  next level.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Marketing, put simply, is connecting with your ideal
                  customers and letting them know that you’re there to help
                  with their beauty and wellness needs. Say your specialty is
                  getting the perfect icy blonde for your clients, it’s
                  imperative you let the icy blonde hopefuls in your area know
                  that you can help them get the look they’re after. They need
                  you and having the right marketing strategy lets them know
                  where to find you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Just like having all the right tools for the perfect
                  haircut, this course will fill your marketing toolbox with
                  everything you need to flourish. Starting with the basics of
                  marketing, you’ll discover how to engage with new and
                  existing customers in an effective and meaningful way.

                  If you’ve ever gone to a restaurant with a menu that’s way
                  too long and ended up ordering the most basic dish you
                  typically make at home, you’ve experienced decision
                  overwhelm. <a href="http://www.firstresearch.com/Industry-Research/Hair-Care-Services.html"
                    class="text_underline" target="_blank">The US
                    hair care industry includes more than
                    80,000 salons and/or barbershops,</a> so you can imagine how
                  overwhelming it may feel for potential customers to find the
                  right salon - to find YOU. Don’t be afraid to stand out from
                  the crowd. Having a quality marketing strategy removes
                  decision overwhelm and drives customers directly to you.

                    company is worth an estimated $900
                    million.</a> There are a lot of brands that sell lipsticks and
                  lip kits but none as popular as Kylie Cosmetics. Founded by
                  Kylie Jenner, the company skyrocketed due to Kylie’s social
                  influence, from a wildly popular TV show to a massive
                  Instagram following, Kylie Cosmetics is a prime example of
                  the value and importance of marketing. Essentially, by
                  creating her own line of products, Kylie has taken decision
                  overwhelm away from her followers. If you’re a fan of hers
                  and lipstick, it’s an easy decision to make to pick up her
                  newest lip kit.

                  In 2021, to be a successful business you must have an online
                  presence. This can be a simple website, Facebook page,
                  and/or Instagram account, or it can stretch across multiple
                  channels and include an in-depth professionally created
                  website. Digital marketing has many benefits, including
                  reaching a wider audience, targeting specific users, and
                  capabilities for future learning. With platforms like

                  One of the most beneficial attributes of digital marketing
                  is that it is interactive. You do not need large budgets for
                  your marketing spend or corporate executives to run a
                  successful campaign. If your ideal customer gets all of
                  their recommendations from Instagram, then that’s a great
                  place to start. You don’t have to be everywhere or in every
                  medium. Meet people where they’re at, and engage, engage,
                  engage with them. Digital marketing is not passive, <a class="text_underline"

                  Know your location. Is local marketing popular where your
                  business is? Do people rely on the local paper? Local print
                  marketing may be the place to meet your potential clients.
                  Only you can answer that. When it comes to print
                  advertising, circulation and use are everything. So, before
                  investing, confirm what the circulation numbers are and what
                  revenues or return on investment (ROI) you can expect.

                  with these results in mind, there’s a lot to be said about
                  coupling digital and print marketing. In addition to
                  conversion rates, integrated campaigns can garner stronger
                  brand recall than digital marketing alone.

                  Time for another example. Let’s look at stylist Vidal
                  Sassoon.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When you think of <a class="text_underline" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18017636" target="_blank">Vidal
                    Sassoon</a> , what comes
                  to mind? The
                  bob, exactly. Known for making the bob popular, the name
                  evokes a feeling of heritage, timeless, and classic style.
                  His notoriety came from working with celebrity clients and,
                  back in the 1950s, he didn’t reach these clients through his
                  Instagram page. However, if you’re looking for a modern-day
                  Sassoon experience you will more than likely start with
                  Sassoon.com.

                  Yes, you want to attract new customers if you’re looking to

                  Attracting new customers to your brand is called acquisition
                  marketing and while the elements may be the same, the

              What’s the first thing you do before making an Amazon purchase?
              Most people will say - read the reviews. In fact, many people
              head to Amazon to read product reviews even if they end up
              purchasing from another retailer. Why? Because social proof is
              important. " Very important. In fact, <b><a class="text_underline"

            This is where you can realize your full marketing potential. Email
            is referred to as pull, not push, marketing. Meaning that your
            email subscribers have come to you and are wanting to hear from
            you compared to you sharing your message out and hoping they will
            hear it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like a text from a good friend, you can provide more value to your
            clients with targeted emails. You can also sent to segmented
            lists, which allows you to get ultra-personal and connect with
            your guests on another level.

                than non-targeted emails.

                  A plan is great, but action is where you see the results,
                  and your metrics are how you measure your success.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is good practice to regularly check in on the success of
                  your campaign so you’re able to assess what worked, and what
                  didn’t, and you can pivot (and celebrate) accordingly.

            Adding a blog or SEO-driven educational content to your website

            Set goals and key content pillars for your blog to ensure it is
            strategic and adding value to your overall strategy. Consider
            whether you want to be somewhere that customers come for tips on
            caring for their hair or skin, or do you want to be a source of
            industry knowledge and insights. Or even both!

            According to statistics from Later.com, over the next 6 years
            social commerce is estimated to increase by 31.4% every year,
            reaching $604.5 billion (about $1,900 per person in the US) by
            2027.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider connecting with your current clients or your ideal client
            on social media for an influencer campaign.
          </p>
          <p class="fst-italic">
            Take Ashley, a beauty influencer for example.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her reach is over 120K on Instagram and 22K on YouTube - this is a
            lot of potential new customers for your business. Working with an
            influencer in your area who has like-minded values can be
            instrumental to your salon or spa marketing. It’s more than just a
            numbers game, look to make authentic connections with nano, micro,
            and/or macro-influencers.
