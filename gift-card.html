                  Gift cards can significantly increase revenue and bring new
                  guests through your doors by turning existing guests into
                  brand evangelists and expanding the market through their
                  influence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But it’s about more than simply having gift cards available.
                  It’s about creating an experience. That’s why we’re sharing
                  examples of creative strategies to expand your gift card
                  horizons and highlight how gift cards can be an important tool
                  in the success of your business.

                    A salon offers a Buy One Get One (BOGO) spring promotion for
                    its gift card program. When a guest buys a gift card for
                    $100, they get a bonus value of $20 added to it.

                    Jane, a loyal customer is motivated by the special offer and
                    the beautiful packaging that she sees at the salon and
                    decides to buy her friend, Carmen, a salon gift card for her
                    birthday
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jane goes to Carmen’s birthday party with a beautiful gift
                    bag from the salon and presents it to her friend. People
                    notice the brand and develop an interest in it. Carmen has
                    never been to this salon before and now she’s excited to go!
                    Jane has now not only created brand awareness with her
                    friend but also with the attendees at the party.

                  <p>
                    Carmen makes an appointment at the salon the following week.
                    As she has never been to the salon before, this is a new
                    guest opportunity for the salon.

                  <p>
                    She enjoys the visit and books a subsequent appointment, and
                    over the course of the 2 visits, she experiences a service
                    she wouldn’t have otherwise tried (for example, a balayage
                    in addition to a haircut) and spends $200 ($120 gift card
                    value and an additional $80 to get 2 great services, instead
                    of just a haircut).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    She’s so happy that she stays on a loyal customer. Thus, the
                    salon earns much more in revenue in the first 2 visits than
                    the value of the gift card, which makes it a worthwhile
                    investment in addition to gaining a new customer.

                    A salon finds out that a new office complex has come up
                    nearby and many small businesses such as physician’s
                    offices, dental offices, law firms, and accounting firms.
                    The salon manager promotes gift cards with the business
                    owners and offers a bulk purchase discount.

                  <p>
                    Two of the business decide to purchase gift cards as holiday

                    Now all these employees are aware of the salon and can
                    experience its services. If they have a total of 50
                    employees and even if just 20% of them like the experience,
                    the proximity and convenience will likely
                    <b>convert those 10 people regular guests. </b>

                    owners will refund the cost of the service in the event of a

                    will keep the money in your business while giving you
                    another chance to wow and win them back.

                    The gifting industry is huge and lucrative and growing very
                    quickly. Gift cards are highly popular, ranking in the US as
                    the second-most given gift by consumers, the most-wanted
                    gift by women, and the third-most wanted by males. More than
                    70% of all US consumers claimed to have purchased a gift
                    card as a present during the holiday season. It is critical
                    to your business to capture a share of this opportunity. If
                    you don’t offer gift cards, you might lose the opportunity
                    to another salon or spa that does.
