                  Gift cards can significantly increase revenue and bring new guests through your doors. 
                </p>
                <p>How? </p>
                <p>
                  By turning existing guests into brand evangelists and expanding your audience through their influence. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  But it’s about more than simply having gift cards available. It’s about creating an experience. 
                </p>
                <p>That’s why we’re sharing examples of creative ways to expand your gift card horizons, motivate purchases, and make gift cards an important tool in the ongoing success of your business.</p>
                <p>Let’s consider a few scenarios where creative use of gift cards can drive success...</p>

                <div class="content-gifting section-padding-3">
                  <p>
                    A salon offers a Buy One Get One (BOGO) spring promotion for its gift card program. When a guest buys a gift card for $100, they get a bonus value of $20 added to it. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jane, a loyal customer is motivated by the special offer and the beautiful packaging that she sees at the salon and decides to buy her friend, Carmen, a salon gift card for her birthday. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jane goes to Carmen’s birthday party with a beautiful gift bag from the salon and presents it to her friend. People notice the brand and develop an interest in it. Carmen has never been to this salon before and now she’s excited to go!

                        store they otherwise wouldn’t have because they’ve
                        received a gift card.

                    Carmen makes an appointment at the salon the following week. She enjoys the visit and books a subsequent appointment. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Over the course of the two visits, she samples a service she wouldn’t have otherwise tried (for example, a balayage in addition to a haircut) and spends $200 ($120 gift card value and an additional $80 to get two great services, instead of just a haircut). She is happy with the experience and becomes a loyal customer.

                        In general, 65% of customers spend  close to 40%
                        more than the value of the card they received.

                  </div>
                  <p class="mb-0">Overall, the gift card program and a small promotional investment of $20 has helped the salon expand its brand awareness, gain a happy new customer, and earn back much more in revenue than the original investment.</p>

                <div class="content-bulk section-padding-3">
                  <p>
                    A new office complex has opened nearby containing many small businesses, such as a physician’s office, dental office, law firm, and accounting firm. The salon manager, Katie, promotes gift cards with the business owners and offers a bulk purchase discount. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Two of the businesses decide to purchase gift cards as holiday gifts for their employees. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now all these employees are aware of the salon and can try its services. If they have a total of 50 employees and just 20% of them like the experience, the proximity and convenience will likely 
                    <b>convert those 10 people into regular guests. </b>
                  </p>
                  <p>Overall, the initial bulk buy purchase discount offered by Katie pays off in the long-term by helping the salon to capture new market opportunities and grow awareness. This results in significant return on investment if just some of this audience becomes regular guests. </p>

                  <p>
                    For example, Steve visits your spa for a massage treatment and is left feeling unsatisfied with the experience. Steve visits the front desk and asks for his money back. Instead of the refund, the front desk team offer him a gift card to return for a future massage for free. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Overall, giving Steve a gift card in this scenario keeps the money in the spa and offers another chance to wow him and win him back.

                    A guest, Felicity, wants to purchase a gift to give to a loved one. Felicity knows that your salon is currently closed due to a COVID lockdown but chooses to buy a gift card so that the recipient has something to look forward to once businesses can reopen.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Overall, this helps you to make up lost revenues and enables Felicity to still support your salon or spa.

                        Zenoti customers earned an 88.6% increase in gift card sales during the COVID lockdown.

                    The gift industry is huge, lucrative and growing very quickly. Gift cards are a popular part of this, ranking in the US as the second-most given gift by consumers, the most-wanted gift by women, and the third-most wanted by males. More than 70% of all US consumers claimed to have purchased a gift card as a present during the holiday season. It is critical to your business to capture a share of this opportunity. If you don’t offer gift cards, you might lose out to another salon or spa that does.
