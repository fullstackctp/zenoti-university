                  Gift cards can significantly increase revenue and bring new
                  guests through your doors.
                </p>
                <p>How?</p>
                <p>
                  By turning existing guests into brand evangelists and
                  expanding your audience through their influence.

                <p>
                  But it’s about more than simply having gift cards available.
                  It’s about creating an experience. That’s why we’re sharing
                  examples of creative strategies to expand your gift card
                  horizons, motivate purchases, and make gift cards an important

                    A salon offers a Buy One Get One (BOGO) spring promotion for
                    its gift card program. When a guest buys a gift card for
                    $100, they get a bonus value of $20 added to it.

                    Jane, a loyal customer is motivated by the special offer and
                    the beautiful packaging that she sees at the salon and
                    decides to buy her friend, Carmen, a salon gift card for her
                    birthday.

                  <p>
                    Jane goes to Carmen’s birthday party with a beautiful gift
                    bag from the salon and presents it to her friend. People
                    notice the brand and develop an interest in it. Carmen has
                    never been to this salon before and now she’s excited to go!
                    Jane has now not only created brand awareness with her
                    friend but also with the attendees at the party.

                    Carmen makes an appointment at the salon the following week.
                    As she has never been to the salon before, this is a new
                    guest opportunity.

                  <p>
                    She enjoys the visit and books a subsequent appointment.
                    Over the course of the two visits, she samples a service she
                    wouldn’t have otherwise tried (for example, a balayage in
                    addition to a haircut) and spends $200 ($120 gift card value
                    and an additional $80 to get two great services, instead of
                    just a haircut).

                  <p>
                    She’s so happy that she becomes a loyal customer. The salon
                    not only earns much more in revenue in the first two visits
                    than the value of the gift card, but also gains a new
                    customer. Demonstrating a very worthwhile investment from
                    the BOGO spring promotion.

                    The gift industry is huge, lucrative and growing very
                    quickly. Gift cards are a popular part of this, ranking in
                    the US as the second-most given gift by consumers, the
                    most-wanted gift by women, and the third-most wanted by
                    males. More than 70% of all US consumers claimed to have
                    purchased a gift card as a present during the holiday
                    season. It is critical to your business to capture a share
                    of this opportunity. If you don’t offer gift cards, you
                    might lose out to another salon or spa that does.
