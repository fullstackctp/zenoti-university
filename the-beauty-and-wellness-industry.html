                  wow them, so you mentally prepare a list of different ideas,
                  from restaurants, theatres, music shows, to a spa day. What

                  Websites may have once just been a digital business card but
                  not anymore. Today, websites represent your entire brand
                  identity. It is your business portfolio, advertising, and
                  receptionist all rolled into one.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Therefore, the time and energy you invest in building a
                  strong online presence can really help to propel your
                  business to the next level. And on the other hand, it can
                  really hinder your growth and customer acquisition if it is
                  not representative of your brand or delivers a negative user
                  experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The beauty and wellness industry is not exempt to the
                  importance of having an online presence. In fact, because we
                  are appointment based and sell a look, our web presence may
                  be most important of all.

                  Your website serves as your greatest tool for tapping into
                  an entirely new audience base of prospective guests.
                  Consider your experience from working at the front desk.
                  Phone interactions with new guests typically take longer
                  than conversations with an existing guest. This is because
                  new visitors have questions (understandably so!) and for
                  that reason like to access a website. A website enables them
                  to have a browse and get a feel for the brand before they
                  make the decision about whether it’s a good fit for them and
                  their needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once your website has caught their attention, they can take
                  their time exploring without feeling like they are imposing
                  on anyone or pressured to make a commitment. Unlike calling
                  a receptionist, who may only have three minutes to book an
                  appointment, a guest accessing your website and online
                  booking platform has no time limit to shopping around. And
                  that is a good thing!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Besides, do your receptionists really have time to talk on
                  the phone with every new guest?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your website is essentially a taste of your business, and
                  the information on your page are your samples. They are
                  being consumed by a lot of people, and you want to pass the
                  test.
