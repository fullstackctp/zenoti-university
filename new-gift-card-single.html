                                While experience gifts can cover a broad range of activities, beauty and wellness experiences are among the most meaningful and can be easily accessed in most cities. There’s growing interest in wellness and rejuvenation to combat the stresses and impact of everyday life, and there’s a significant opportunity for salons and spas to capture this market through gift cards. When your core business is built around making people look and feel good, you’re one of the best places for your guests to buy an experience gift for their loved ones.

                                Gift cards can significantly increase revenue and bring new guests through your doors. They can turn existing guests into brand evangelists and expand your audience through their influence.

                                Gift cards are hugely popular, ranking in the US as the second-most given gift. They are the most-wanted gift by women and the third-most wanted by males. More than 70% of all US consumers claimed to have purchased a gift card as a present during recent holiday seasons. It is vital for your business to capture a share of this opportunity. If you don’t offer gift cards, you might lose out to another salon or spa that does.

                                    For example, Steve visits your spa for a massage treatment and is left feeling unsatisfied with the experience. He visits the front desk and asks for his money back. Instead of a refund, the front desk team offers Steve a gift card for a free massage on a future visit.

                                   Overall, giving Steve a gift card in this scenario keeps the money in the spa and creates another chance for the spa to wow him and win him back. It also makes him more likely to spread the word to others that his potentially negative visit was resolved positively.

                                    Selling gift cards online is a must-have convenience for your consumers. This not only lets clients easily give gifts to others, it also lets their friends and family give them a gift they know your client will love – all from the convenience of their computer or mobile device.

Felicity knew your salon was closed due to a COVID lockdown, but she chose to buy a digital gift card anyway. That way, her friend had something to look forward once your salon reopened.

Zenoti customers earned an 88.6% increase in gift card sales during the COVID lockdown.

                                   Digital gift cards are not only easy to buy on your computer or phone, they also make it convenient for the recipient to redeem using an app or card reader to speed up the checkout process.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                   Gift cards purchased online can also be personalized and customized in more ways than a physical one, including gifting a service or product rather than a dollar amount and sharing a note or sentiment. This customization is one of the reasons digital gift cards are more versatile.

                                    Set yourself up for success and allow customization in your gift cards. Some guests want to share a favorite service with friends and family, while others want to gift a dollar amount. Providing flexibility in the type of gift offered will drive more sales. Allowing the gift card buyer to customize the gift card adds a further purchase incentive as they can still add personalization for the recipient.

                                    If a friend loves massages, gifting them one at your favorite spa (and maybe even going with them) makes it more personal than receiving a monetary gift card. Adding a personalized design or message on a digital gift card also makes the experience more satisfying for the gift giver who may miss being able to deliver it in person.

                                  Gift cards should be easy to purchase from your mobile app or webstore. If customers must hunt for it on your website, they may give up before they find it. On the other hand, if someone is visiting your website and they see gift cards placed front and center, they may be inspired to buy one even if that was not the original reason for their visit. Zenoti customer, EvelineCharles Salon and Spa proudly displays gift cards as a “Shop Online” drop-down directly on the homepage of their website.
