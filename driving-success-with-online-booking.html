                <p class="mt-3">
                  These days, online booking is an expectation. Guests want the
                  convenience of being able to access the scheduler anytime,
                  anywhere with the click of a button. Without worrying if their
                  kids are screaming, traffic noises interfering or that they
                  are out of breath from having just got off the treadmill, like
                  you would with a phone call. Almost half of individuals prefer
                  to make a booking outside of business hours. After all, we all
                  think about our to-do list when we are falling asleep don’t
                  we?

                  Online booking is also proven to improve visit frequency.
                  Amongst Zenoti customers, guests who book an appointment
                  online visit 1 more time per year, or book 10 days sooner than
                  guests who book via phone. One visit may not seem like a lot,
                  but multiple that by the number of different guests that you
                  see in a year, and you are talking about serious revenue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, online booking significantly helps to reduce the
                  number of no-shows that affect your business. Particularly if
                  you request credit card information to finalize the booking.
                  Through their partnership with Zenoti, a leading salon
                  customer decreased no-show appointments by 35%, recapturing a
                  little over 1/3 of their bookable appointment blocks.
