                  <p>Let’s look at Kylie Cosmetics, for example. </p>
                  <p>Founded in 2015, the company <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2019/03/05/at-21-kylie-jenner-becomes-the-youngest-self-made-billionaire-ever/?sh=6699d9be2794" target="_blank">is worth an estimated $900 million.</a> There are a lot of brands that sell lipsticks and lip kits but none as popular as Kylie Cosmetics. </p>
                  <p>Founded by Kylie Jenner, the company skyrocketed due to Kylie’s social influence, from a wildly popular TV show to a massive Instagram following, Kylie Cosmetics is a prime example of the value and importance of marketing. Essentially, by creating her own line of products, Kylie has taken decision overwhelm away from her followers. If you’re a fan of hers and lipstick, it’s an easy decision to make to pick up her newest lip kit. </p>
