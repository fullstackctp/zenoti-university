                    Let’s look at Kylie Cosmetics, for example.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Founded in 2015, the company
                    worth an estimated $900 million.
                    There are a lot of brands that sell lipsticks and lip kits
                    but none as popular as Kylie Cosmetics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Founded by Kylie Jenner, the company skyrocketed due to
                    Kylie’s social influence, from a wildly popular TV show to a
                    massive Instagram following, Kylie Cosmetics is a prime
                    example of the value and importance of marketing.
                    Essentially, by creating her own line of products, Kylie has
                    taken decision overwhelm away from her followers. If you’re
                    a fan of hers and lipstick, it’s an easy decision to make to
                    pick up her newest lip kit.
