                    Gift cards can be made available in both physical and
                    digital formats, and most savvy businesses leverage both

                    Digital gift cards are not only easy to buy from anywhere on
                    your computer or phone, but they also make it convenient for
                    the recipient to pay for their services using an app or card
                    reader to speed up the checkout process.

                  <p>
                    Online gift cards can also be personalized and customized in
                    more ways than a physical gift card, including gifting a
                    service or product vs. a dollar amount. This customization
                    is one of the reasons digital gift cards more versatile
                    (more on that below).

                    Smart businesses allow customization in their gift cards.
                    Some guests want to share a favorite service with friends
                    and family, while others want to gift a dollar amount.
                    Providing flexibility in the type of gift offered will
                    enable your business to see more sales. Allowing the gift
                    card buyer to customize the gift card will also allow them
                    to personalize it for their recipient.

                    If you know that your friend loves pedicures, offering them
                    a gift of a spa pedicure at your favorite spa (and maybe
                    even going with them!) will make it much more personal than
                    receiving a monetary gift card. Being able to add a
                    personalized design or message on a digital gift card will
                    also make the experience more satisfying for the gift giver
                    who may miss being able to deliver it in person.

                    <p><strong>Holiday Party Tip : </strong>Go the extra step and hold a holiday “gifting party.” Invite customers (and their friends) to shrink their holiday shopping list by stocking up on gift certificates for friends and family at your center—and make it a party. Wine them, dine them, and sell those cards. </p>
                    <p><strong>Leverage Guest Data: </strong>Other popular gift giving occasions involve days that are personal and special to the recipient – these include birthdays and wedding anniversaries. Businesses that can leverage their customer information to create personalized offers for these occasions can increase their gift card sales </p>
                    <p><strong>Go Beyond the Holiday Season : </strong>You can also get creative and promote gift giving for a variety of other events and even based on the seasons. Here are some seasonal promos you might consider :
                        <ul style="padding-left: 2rem !important;">
                            <li>Spring Promo- Get a fresh haircut, manicure, etc. to be ready for the season.</li>
                            <li>Summer Fun/Memorial Day Promo- Get a new hair style or a spa day to celebrate the summer.</li>
                            <li>Fall/Back to School Promo- Invest in some self-care before the start of the school year.</li>
