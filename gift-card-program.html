                    Digital gift cards are not only easy to buy from anywhere on
                    your computer or phone, but they also make it convenient for
                    the recipient to pay for their services using an app or card
                    reader to speed up the checkout process.

                  <p>
                    Online gift cards can also be personalized and customized in 
                    more ways than a physical gift card, including gifting a 
                    service or product vs. a dollar amount. This customization 
                    is one of the reasons digital gift cards are more versatile (more on that below).

                  <p class="section-padding-3">
                    Set yourself up for success and allow customization in your gift cards. Some guests want to share a favorite service with friends and family, while others want to gift a dollar amount. Providing flexibility in the type of gift offered will drive more sales. Allowing the gift card buyer to customize the gift card adds a further purchase incentive as they can still add personalization for the recipient. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you know that your friend loves massages, gifting them a massage at your favorite spa (and maybe even going with them) makes it much more personal than receiving a monetary gift card. Being able to add a personalized design or message on a digital gift card also makes the experience more satisfying for the gift giver who may miss being able to deliver it in person.

                        <strong>Encourage Gift Card Purchases at the Front Desk : </strong>create a beautiful card rack at the front desk and let the visual appeal do the selling for you. Remember, these are gifts so offer sleek envelopes or attractive boxes to house the gift card and remove the packaging step from your busy customer’s to-do list. And remember to keep the display and packaging on brand. Every element of your business should reflect the brand logo and color scheme wherever possible.

                    <p><strong>Holiday Party Tip: </strong>Go the extra step and hold a holiday “gifting party.” Invite customers (and their friends) to shrink their holiday shopping list by stocking up on gift certificates for friends and family at your center—and make it a party. Wine them, dine them, and sell those cards. </p>
                    <p><strong>Leverage Guest Data: </strong>Other popular gift giving occasions involve days that are personal and special to the recipient – these include birthdays and wedding anniversaries. Salons and spas that can leverage their customer information to create personalized offers for these occasions can increase their gift card sales.</p>
                    <p><strong>Go Beyond the Holiday Season: </strong>You can also get creative and promote gift giving for a variety of other events. For example, here are some seasonal promos you might consider:
                        <ul style="padding-left: 2rem !important;">
                            <li><b>Spring Promo:</b> get a fresh haircut, manicure, etc. to be ready for the new season.</li>
                            <li><b>Summer Fun/Memorial Day Promo:</b> get a new hair style or a spa day to celebrate the summer.</li>
                            <li><b>Fall/Back to School Promo:</b> invest in some self-care before the start of the school year.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Once your program gets rolling, use a tool, like <a target="_blank" href="https://go.zenoti.com/smart-marketing.html"> Zenoti’s integrated marketing software,</a> to create marketing campaigns and promotions specifically for those who have purchased gift cards to keep them informed about upcoming card deals and promotions.
