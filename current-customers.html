              This is where you can realize your full marketing potential. Email is referred to as pull not push marketing. Meaning that your email subscribers have come to you and are wanting to hear from you compared to you sharing your message out and hoping they will hear it. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Like a text from a good friend, you can provide more value to your clients with targeted emails, sent to segmented lists, which allows you to get ultra-personal and connect with your guests on another level.
