                    The original 80/20 rule has nothing to do with the ratio of
                    veggies to carbs on your plate. It’s been shown that

              This is where you can realize your full marketing potential. Email
              is referred to as pull, not push, marketing. Meaning that your email
              subscribers have come to you and are wanting to hear from you
              compared to you sharing your message out and hoping they will hear
              it.

            <p>
              Like a text from a good friend, you can provide more value to your
              clients with targeted emails, sent to segmented lists, which
              allows you to get ultra-personal and connect with your guests on
              another level.

              With Zenoti Smart Marketing you can create both scheduled and

              This loyalty program was launched in 2007 and recently, in 2020,
              got an upgrade. This program offers perks for members and is free
              for everyone to join at the base level. It includes tiers and
              special privileges for members and further confirms the 80/20 with
              80% of sales contributed to program members. The program includes
              email campaigns that evolve over time, are based on customer data
              and are focused on only sending what is relevant to each client.
              And this has paid off with an 80% (there’s that magic number
              again) higher open rate than non-targeted emails.
