                  Not convinced? We looked at our customers who have a focused
                  gift card program and found that gift cards contribute up to
                  35% of their revenue (even more in the case of high-end spas).
                  This highlights the impact gift cards are having on overall
                  revenue and profitability for salons and spas.

                    The gift industry is huge, lucrative and growing very
                    quickly. Gift cards are a popular part of this, ranking in
                    the US as the second-most given gift by consumers, the
                    most-wanted gift by women, and the third-most wanted by
                    males. More than 70% of all US consumers claimed to have
                    purchased a gift card as a present during the holiday
                    season. It is critical to your business to capture a share
                    of this opportunity. If you don’t offer gift cards, you
                    might lose out to another salon or spa that does.

                    Digital gift cards are not only easy to buy from anywhere on
                    your computer or phone, but they also make it convenient for
                    the recipient to pay for their services using an app or card
                    reader to speed up the checkout process.

                  <p>
                    Online gift cards can also be personalized and customized in
                    more ways than a physical gift card, including gifting a
                    service or product vs. a dollar amount. This customization
                    is one of the reasons digital gift cards are more versatile
                    (more on that below).

                    Set yourself up for success and allow customization in your
                    gift cards. Some guests want to share a favorite service
                    with friends and family, while others want to gift a dollar
                    amount. Providing flexibility in the type of gift offered
                    will drive more sales. Allowing the gift card buyer to
                    customize the gift card adds a further purchase incentive as
                    they can still add personalization for the recipient.

                    If you know that your friend loves massages, gifting them a
                    massage at your favorite spa (and maybe even going with
                    them) makes it much more personal than receiving a monetary
                    gift card. Being able to add a personalized design or
                    message on a digital gift card also makes the experience
                    more satisfying for the gift giver who may miss being able
                    to deliver it in person.

                        180% jump in gift card revenue during holiday months so
                        it’s important to plan ahead for these events.

                    <strong>Holiday Party Tip: </strong>Go the extra step and
                    hold a holiday “gifting party.” Invite customers (and their
                    friends) to shrink their holiday shopping list by stocking
                    up on gift certificates for friends and family at your
                    center—and make it a party. Wine them, dine them, and sell
                    those cards.

                    <strong>Leverage Guest Data: </strong>Other popular gift
                    giving occasions involve days that are personal and special
                    to the recipient – these include birthdays and wedding
                    anniversaries. Salons and spas that can leverage their
                    customer information to create personalized offers for these
                    occasions can increase their gift card sales.

                    <strong>Go Beyond the Holiday Season: </strong>You can also
                    get creative and promote gift giving for a variety of other
                    events. For example, here are some seasonal promos you might
                    consider:
                  </p>
                  <ul style="padding-left: 2rem !important">
                    <li>
                      <b>Spring Promo:</b> get a fresh haircut, manicure, etc.
                      to be ready for the new season.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Summer Fun/Memorial Day Promo:</b>get a new hair style
                      or a spa day to celebrate the summer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Fall/Back to School Promo:</b> invest in some self-care
                      before the start of the school year.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Once your program gets rolling, use a tool, like Zenoti’s
                    integrated marketing software, to create marketing campaigns
                    and promotions specifically for those who have purchased
                    gift cards to keep them informed about upcoming card deals
                    and promotions.
