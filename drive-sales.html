                    Have you ever finished styling a guest’s hair only to be reminded of another guest who hasn’t been back for a while? Or sat down for a well-earned coffee and wondered what happened to this guest or that individual who promised they would return?

                    This means, that if 100 guests visited your brand last month, 70 of those won’t return. 		While perhaps painful to hear, it’s important to understand guests are not guaranteed. They can 	be lost to the competition, employee turnover, prices, moving away, an unpleasant experience 	or many other factors.

                  Getting new clients is the lifeblood of any business, so if your aim is to grow then you need to 	grow your guest base. Even if you have the most loyal customers in the world who regularly 	rebook appointments and visit for treatments, you won’t see growth unless new guests are also 	coming in. Ultimately, guest count is a numbers game. The more guests you have, the more 	opportunities there are for them to invest in your services, products and brand - 	which equates 	to a growing profit.

                  The more guests that experience what your brand offers, the more ambassadors you have in your corner. Word of mouth continues to be one of the leading sources of new guest acquisition. The more guests you have speaking fondly about your brand, the more your brand will be recognized, and the more appointments there will be in the book!

              Max Depree said, “We cannot become what we want by remaining what we are.”

            <p>
              The same theory goes for your guest base. You cannot reach your goals by remaining content with the guests you once earned. Seek growth by tapping into guests that have yet to consider your business for their needs.
