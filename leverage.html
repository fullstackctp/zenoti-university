                    When guests consistently choose your business over a competitor that offers similar services or products, they are loyal to your brand. Their purchase decision is less influenced by price or availability but instead from relationships they have built or positive experiences they have had with your salon or spa previously. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Therefore, if a customer is loyal, they aren’t easily influenced to switch to a new brand based on short-term benefits. Instead, they value the quality and familiarity of your brand, which they are already established with. It's important not to underestimate the value of this loyalty. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Loyalty programs have evolved significantly over the last decade, with the advent of new technologies, and now come in a number of different styles and formats. From points for dollar spend, to referral rewards, and social media shares, there’s a loyalty program to suit every need and business goal. Ultimately, the continued and growing popularity of loyalty programs across multiple industries indicates its high business value.

                      Starbucks’ app has strengthened its relationships with customers by empowering them to order and pay through before arrival and earn rewards such as free food, drinks, and merchandise. Customers in the rewards program also benefit from perks like free birthday drinks, access to special events, knowledge on upcoming product releases, and the ability to send gift cards through the app.

                      Our data also shows that unsurprisingly they spend 6-7 times as much in a year as the guests who visit 3 or fewer times, and even on a per visit basis they tend to spend more than average. 
                    <p>
                      Our data clearly displays the business value that loyal customers have. Not only are they coming back time and time again but they actually spend more once there. This ties back to our earlier point about loyal customers being more receptive to product recommendations and upsells.
