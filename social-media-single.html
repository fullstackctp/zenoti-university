            Looking to utilize the ever-growing medium of social media to
            support your business goals, but not sure where to start? This
            course is designed to help you understand what organic social
            media can do for you and why it is an important tool to help your
            business grow in a digitally driven world.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a long time, businesses have relied on word of mouth and
            referrals to attract new customers and build a following. The
            influence people have on their friends in terms of choosing a
            salon or stylist has a big impact on how that company can bring in
            new customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Social media has exploded this trend and given people from all
            over the world the power to share their opinions on an
            ever-expanding scale. It is also an increasingly important source
            for building trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consumers now look to visual platforms, such as Instagram and
            Pinterest, for health and wellness inspiration. So, knowing how to
            catch their attention and stand out is key to driving engagement
            with current and future customers. During this course we will go
            back to basics to build out a solid foundational understanding of
            social media practices. These core principles will help guide your
            social media strategy and allow you to create digital marketing
            initiatives that deliver meaningful business results.

              When we talk about a social media presence, we are usually
              referring to the strategic use of the following platforms, which
              each have unique features for different digital audiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              These four platforms were chosen based on relevance to the
              industry, with Instagram having the highest recommendation, due
              to its visual nature and the way audiences engage with content.
              For example, where do you look when you want to find the perfect
              new hair style, or balayage color? Instagram. For salons,
              Instagram is a mobile lookbook that acts in the same way as a
              digital business card.
            </p>
            <p>
              Facebook is probably a close second due to its popularity with a
              complementary demographic. Instagram and Facebook are also
              integrated, so you can post the same content on both platforms.
              Pinterest would be recommended for similar reasons to Instagram
              but is less popular, and mostly used to communicate one way -
              meaning it does not have a community aspect. Lastly, TikTok, the newest member of the social media crew,
              has come in strong with video content that encompasses everything from tutorials to before and after
              looks.

                  One unique benefit of social media, that sets it apart from
                  other marketing channels, is the ability to build an online
                  community and user-generated content (UGC). This encourages
                  conversation about your brand, as well as involving the
                  consumer directly within the content creation process by
                  allowing them to tag and share their own visuals of your
                  company.

            Have you ever bought the latest beauty, health, or wellness “must-have” purely because everyone else had it?
            Social media, when not used correctly, can feel a little bit like that. Everyone is on it, so brands want to
            be present on it too. But, without the proper direction and strategy, these brands end up just getting lost
            in the noise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though we know that social media is a crucial tool in the
            marketing mix, you still need to be selective about which channels
            and platforms make the most sense for your company. Just like a
            good massage is tailored to benefit each person, your social media
            strategy needs to be created with your brand and target audience
            at the center.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you know that your products or services are targeted towards a younger audience, you may focus on
            Instagram and TikTok instead of Facebook. Be true to your brand, and don’t be afraid to say no when it makes
            sense to do so.

            Nothing works well in isolation. Just like you wouldn’t apply only

          <p>
            If your overall business objective is to grow brand awareness,

            towards this as well. Similarly, if your company is aiming to
            raise sales numbers, then the content should reflect this. Think
            about your audience and what actions you would like them to take.
